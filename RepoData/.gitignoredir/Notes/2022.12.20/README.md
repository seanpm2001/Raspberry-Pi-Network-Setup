# Notes about the current description

## 2022, December 20th

On 2022, Thursday, December 15th, as part of a new modernization process of adding Emojis to my projects descriptions, I updated this projects description to this:

```
🍓️🖥️📔️ My personal and professional Raspberry Pi setups, along with my Raspberry Pi daily blog.
```

You may notice a problem with the first Emoji. I have known for 5 days that the berry in the description is NOT a raspberry, but is in fact a strawberry. I would have used a raspberry, but there currently isn't an official raspberry Emoji.

Hopefully we can get a raspberry emoji in the future. For the meantime, please try to ignore this "typo" as there is nothing I can do to fix it.

Also, I was 5 days late on writing this message.
