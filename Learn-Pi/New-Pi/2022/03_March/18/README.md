<!-- It has been decided that goals will be split across 7 day intervals, as I can't get to everything in one day. !-->

This is my personal blog for my usage of a Raspberry Pi as a computing platform.

**My setup:** [Canakit Raspberry Pi 4 extreme edition 8 GB RAM [Canakit.com] [⚠️ Link contains trackers]](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-4-extreme-aluminum-case-kit.html) with 2 1080p TV screens (used as monitors) a wired RGB keyboard, and a wireless mouse
M
_Unfortunately, the 8 gigabyte model I have is currently sold out and is on backorder until at least 2022 February 28th. You currently cannot buy one. I wish I would have known this before I wrote it into the entry yesterday, as it feels a bit selfish without given context._

Update: as of 2022 March 9th/13th, the 8 gigabyte model is still out of stock, with no indicator on when it will return. The same now goes for the 4 gigabyte model. You can currently only obtain the 2 gigabyte model.

**TV [2x]** - [`[Amazon link]`](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08Z1QQNV4/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_TW7Y9GDDSNHAVA8A7487?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)

- Note: this TV is both a privacy and security risk. Despite not fully setting up the system, and not connecting any web apps, it may still be monitoring. It doesn't have a microphone or a camera, but if it can access the Pi on HDMI1, it might be a real issue. Unfortunately for now, it is all I have.

**Wall mount [2x]** - [`[Amazon link]`](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV8DKYF/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_RPTRV9YQR2B23KV8ZGYN?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)

- Note: requires installation with a drill. Not a privacy or security risk, as it isn't digital.

**Game controller [2x]** - [`[Amazon link`]](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MBF7FN1/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_N34EBX94T61HRZCW4PQE?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)

<!-- _I forgot to list this originally. I will have to request the link for it._ !-->

TL;DR: This isn't a normal input device, it is for emulators and video game consoles only.

- Note: this input device isn't compatible with Raspbian/Raspberry Pi OS. It is designed for RetroPie and EmulationStation. You will need a separate device running RetroPie or a specific game console/other-Linux/MacOS with USB 3 support to use this device

**Keyboard [1x]** - [`[Amazon link]`](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0797NX6D5/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_20FTDTAV54BS85RJWHNR?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)

- Note: this is a wired RGB keyboard. It does not pose any privacy or security risks.

**Mouse [1x]** - [`[Amazon link]`](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0836GXKKB/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_SHASZ4918T11ET8VTP7F?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)

- Note: the mouse will only work with the Pi if you plug the mouse adaptor into the Raspberry Pi.

**[Limited edition] RetroPower NES Brick case kit** [`[Amazon link]`](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KCQ9QQV/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_HW75JG8H401M4HAA7QDH?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)

A building block case that looks like an NES, but contains bootleg branding (RetroPower). Despite not being Lego, it is confirmed to be Lego compatible. This item is likely to no longer exist in the future, that is why it is labeled as `[limited edition]`

#### Raspberry Pi daily blog

This blog goes over what I learnt on the Raspberry Pi day by day, and also what I did with the Raspberry Pi.

##### 2022 January 13th

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</u></b></p></summary>

- [x] That the Raspberry Pi has its own package manager, and it really gives a more professional Linux feel (similar to that of Fedora or Arch Linux)

- [x] That the Raspberry Pi may be able to be merged into a second Pi to double the specs (theory)

- [x] That you can't just install Firefox for the Raspberry Pi, you have to go through a package manager and choose either an ESR (Extended Support Releases) or an RR (Rapid Release) build

##### 2022 January 14th

- [x] The package manager is known as `Add or remove programs`

- [x] You have to checkmark the selected program before clicking `[ OK ]` to install it

- [x] Programs require entering a password each time to install

- [x] How to use and customize Applets

- [x] The CPU temperature Applet is set to Celsius by default

- [ ] No other knowledge gained today

##### 2022 January 15th

- [x] Firefox is a pain to install (currently can't even get the ESR version to install through the package manager)

- [x] The default screenshot program is known as `scrot`

- [x] The default desktop environment is LXQT

- [x] The system uses less than 100 megabytes of RAM

- [x] The system is actually called Raspberry Pi OS, it is no longer called RaspbianOS

- [x] To disable automatic sleep mode, go to `Preferences` > `Raspberry Pi Configuration` > `Display` > `Screen Blanking:` > Disable (Note: from what I was reading, if the option is græyed out, then there is something using this function, and you need to disable it/turn it off before trying again. I can't remember what it was right now, my system didn't have the issue)

- - [x] Test successful: System stayed on for more than 15 minutes (1.4+ hours) while idle without going into sleep mode

- [x] To show the same wallpaper on both desktops, go to `Preferences` > [I will fill this in another time]

- [x] The package manager closes upon successful installation of a program.

- [x] Bug: when left idle, CPU usage goes to 25% with LibreOffice open, and using LibreOffice for 5 seconds brings it back down to 2%

- [x] Chromium really sucks, and I can't install other browsers. I tested Google Docs, and it doesn't even show you your documents, or keep you signed in, because immediately upon refreshing or clicking any link, it prompts you to sign back in. Google shot themselves in the foot on this one, as they did this on purpose. I remember hearing something about Chromium removing sync several months ago, I feel this is what it was. I can tell because other sites like ProtonMail function perfectly. I am at least glad that DuckDuckGo is the default search engine, and I didn't have to change it, and uBlock origin is pre-installed, but it still sucks, because its Chromium.

- [x] The bluetooth indicator flashes between blue and green when 

- [x] Raspberry Pi OS uses the LXQT desktop environment by default on full installations, but uses the PIXEL desktop environment on light installations

- [x] The Raspberry Pi allows the change of iB to B (ibytes to bytes, such as Mebibytes to Megabytes) and vice versa

- [x] I can't determine the file system that my PI uses yet, but I can tell it doesn't have the restrictive character limits of NTFS (Windows NT's file system from Windows 2000/Windows XP onward) meaning all characters are allowed in file/folder names (except for `/`) just like my laptop. I wonder if it is ext.

<b>Programs installed today:</b>

- [x] Gedit

- [x] GNOME Solitaire Collection

##### 2022 January 16th

- [x] What the file transfer dialog looks like

- [x] Today I opened Scratch 3 for the first time. I have never used the desktop version of it. It still really sucks when compared to Scratch 2, and I likely won't use it

- [x] Someday in the future (maybe when I am having a sick day) I would like to just lay low and make Scratch 2 projects, just like old times.

- [x] `Always show full file names` is not a preference for me, as it makes it really hard to navigate, since file names with tons of characters use multiple rows of space

- [x] VLC is functional, I tested it today.

- [x] The trash can on LXQT has a full icon when content is in it, similar to GNOME and Windows NT

- [x] Nothing else learnt today

<b>Programs installed today:</b>

- [x] Neofetch

- [x] YouTube-DL

- [x] Cowsay (although I can't get it to work yet)

##### 2022 January 17th

- [x] No data for today.

Todays activity: Hardly used, journal moved from Raspberry Pi back to laptop, device left idle.

##### 2022 January 18th

- [x] No data for today.

Todays activity: Hardly used, device mostly left idle.

##### 2022 January 19th

- [x] Wallpapers are located at `///usr/share/rpd-wallpaper/`

- [x] Nothing else learnt today

Todays activity: Did a few image downloads, short web browsing session, located Raspberry Pi wallpaper location and uploaded it privately, then uploaded it publicly; also copied to `///home/Pi/Pictures/` | All unlocked Pie folders moved into the oven folder. Mostly left idle other than that.

##### 2022 January 20th

- [x] Nothing learnt today

Todays activity: Left idle for most of the day, no web browser usage. Neofetch ran to show to my Raspberry Pi learning partner.

##### 2021 January 21st

_Some of these observations come from a SAFFUN game controller._

- [x] The RetroPie game controller I use has to have an adapter plugged in before starting up

- [x] The controller I have is wireless, and the wire cannot be used to connect it, only to charge it

- [x] To exit a game, press `SELECT` and `START` at the same time

- [x] To change the resolution of RetroPie, go to **INSTRUCTIONS COMING SOON**

- [x] The default resolution is set to 1280x720@?Hz for the current setup, but was changed to 1920x1080@60Hz

- [x] The RetroPie mostly uses display 1, the display stays idle on display 2 once starting a game [needs further testing]

- [x] Nothing else learnt today

Todays activity: booted the Pi up later in the day to play games for about an hour (8:36 pm to 9:33 pm, ~57 minutes) via RetroPie. Played [Nintendo-GBA] Sonic Advance 1 [North America, English] up to Angel Island Zone act 2 before dying, and finding that save states don't exist/aren't configured for this game. Also played [Nintendo-GB] Super Mario Land 2 - 6 gold coins briefly. Shut down safely.

##### 2022 January 22nd

- [x] Nothing new learnt today

I did not use the Raspberry Pi at all today.

##### 2022 January 23rd

- [x] The Scratch 2 port for Raspberry Pi uses the Electron framework

- [x] Scratch 2 is highly unstable on Raspberry Pi, and will crash if you navigate through too many directories (both the save prompt and the program)

- [x] Nothing else learnt today

I used the Raspberry Pi briefly today to use Scratch 2 for graphics. It was left idle for most of the day.

##### 2021 January 24th

- [x] Nothing new learnt today

I did not use the Raspberry Pi at all today. I didn't have the time for it, I was really busy with another project.

##### 2022 January 25th

- [x] The Raspberry Pi doesn't support the Korean language by default (Which is odd, because even Ubuntu supports Korean, and I still don't feel like my system supports enough languages in Unicode when compared to Windows 7 or Windows 10, and mostly because Korean is more widely spoken than some languages that are supported (as of today, over 80 million people speak Korean))

- [x] Despite passing `--fix-missing` after installation, some packages I installed are still broken (Confirmed broken: `YouTube-DL` | Unconfirmed to be broken: `Cowsay` | Confirmed to work: `Neofetch`)

- [x] It is best to open the shortcut of a program on the screen you want it to open on. For example, for personal preference, I should navigate to desktop2 before launching the task manager, that way, it will launch on desktop2, and not desktop1

- [x] Nothing else learnt today

I used the Raspberry Pi briefly today. I wanted to view a document that kept crashing my laptop, and took the risk of opening it on the Pi. I can now view the document without issue, all 132 pages, except for some Korean characters (less than 0.001% of the document) that appear as blank hoxes. I mostly left the Raspberry Pi idle, and didn't do anything else today.

##### 2022 January 26th

- [x] Applets cannot be interacted with in the toolbar

- [x] The Raspberry Pi has very poor Emoji support. The only Emoji so far I have noted to not work is: `Globe with meridians` or `🌐️` but emojis such as the checkmark are more text-like than Emoji like

- [x] Nothing else learnt today

I used the Raspberry Pi for work on my document regarding notes for project tasks. I didn't do anything else with it today.

##### 2022 January 27th

- [x] Nothing new learnt today

I used the Raspberry Pi for document work again today, but for once, I didn't learn anything while using it. I didn't do anything else with it today.

##### 2022 January 28th

- [x] The version of Chromium the Raspberry Pi uses isn't supported by GitHub, so I can't sign in to it on there.

- [x] You cannot copy and paste a file into its own folder, it won't add a `(1)` or a `(copy)` at the end of the name

- [x] VLC Exporting from WebM to MP3 works fine. It exports at the same speed as my laptop, and the file appears to be functional, but partially recognizes the exported file as a plain text file (icon-wise) but a functional MP3 file other than that. I need to test it across devices first, and also to attempt other conversion types (such as MKV to MP3, WebM to OGG, MP4 to MP3, etc.) it also doesn't tax my CPU, or cache, unlike my other device.

- [x] I have been doing `.desktop` files all wrong. They render as application shortcuts on the Raspberry Pi, and can have multiple file display names.

- [x] The interface and long loading times of extracting a BZ2 file of only 150 megabytes

- [x] Basic info on the SD card copying too, unknown if it can be used to backup onto an external device other than an SD card

- [x] You cannot obtain Firefox easily through the built-in web browser, confirming what I read

- [x] `.desktop` files have special options, and can be executed normally or through a terminal through a popup window

- [x] `xterm` is not installed by default.

- [x] Kazam is a screenshot and screencast/screen recording tool that supposedly works well with the Raspberry PI.

- [x] Nothing else learnt today

<b>Attempted installations today:</b>

- [ ] Firefox 94 (through web browser) (❌️ unsuccessful) 

- [ ] Firefox 94 (BZ2 source code) (❌️ unsuccessful)

- [ ] xterm (through `add and remove software`) (❌️ unsuccessful)

- [ ] Kazam (through `add and remove software`) (❌️ unsuccessful)

I used the Raspberry PI for document work yet again today. I finished importing a few months worth of notes and organizing them. I also did a test today, and found out that GitHub isn't supported by the default browser of the Raspberry Pi. The GitHub docs page for the list of supported browsers won't even stay loaded for more than 1 second without blanking out. I also used VLC media player today as a test, and I received good results. The only thing stopping me from resuming audio conversion is the inability to take a good screenshot that isn't 2 screens wide without having to individually crop each image, and the inability to take a screenshot of just the current window, and nothing else without having to individually crop each image. I also downloaded a copy of my audio database in preparation for possible continued exports.

I made significant progress with learning the Raspberry Pi 4 system today, but had severe difficulties in further attempts to install a different web browser, along with software in general. I shut the Raspberry Pi down early tonight, as I couldn't spend any more time with it, I am already really behind, and it isn't helping me get caught up.

##### 2022 January 29th

- [x] Some programs, such as VLC, can only have 1 open instance

- [x] The Raspberry Pi version of VLC converts OGG files 6x slower than it converts MP3 files

- [x] Nothing else learnt today

I used the Raspberry Pi for audio conversion today.

##### 2022 January 30th

- [x] Nothing new learnt today.

I used the Raspberry Pi for audio conversion again today. There were no issues booting the device today.

Side note: this device has 8 gigabytes of RAM, but the system is so lightweight that, to date, I have never used more than 700 megabytes of RAM at once, not even that close to a gigabyte.

##### 2022 January 31st

- [x] Results on 8 video to audio conversion types:

- * Fast

- MP4 -> MP3

- WebM -> MP3

- MKV -> MP3

- m4a -> MP3

- * Slow

- MP4 -> OGG

- WebM -> OGG

- MKV -> OGG

- m4a -> OGG

- [x] Nothing else learnt today

I used the Raspberry Pi for audio conversion yet again today. Today when booting up, it didn't make it to the desktop, and lost its signal, so I had to hard reset it. It booted successfully on the second try.

What I did today was converting video files to audio files, and adding metadata to them (Description, artist, track number, language, genres, album art, etc.)

That is all I did today. I estimate that I have put about 205 gigabyte hours (for: WRITE(Copy)/DELETE) onto this SD card. I am concerned about possible failure, and my fear grew larger after the issue booting today.

##### 2022 February 1st

- [x] Turning off Wi-Fi is extremely simple, and won't glitch out and prevent it from being re-enabled

- [x] What the No Internet icon looks like

- [x] The Chrome dinosaur game also works in Chromium, still need to get a better browser though (still no luck on installing Firefox, Waterfox, Konquerer, SeaMonkey, GNU IceCat, or any other non-Google browser)

- [x] Nothing else learnt today

Today on my Rasberry Pi, I was going to do some audio conversion, but never got the spirit for doing it. There were no issues booting up again today. The device was mostly left idle today, except for my todo list being worked on, and being bumped to revision 75. Near the end of my session, before shutting down, I disabled the Wi-Fi connection, as it isn't worth having this device connected to the Internet 24/7. 

##### 2022 February 2nd

<!-- Notes 2022.02.02
No boot issues
The raspberry Pi has no internal clock, and relies on the Internet for time

- [x] The Raspberry Pi has no internal clock, and cannot get the time without a Wi-Fi connection

- [x] Nothing else learnt today

There were no boot issues today. Today, I resumed adding metadata to converted audio, but made a mistake with about 25% of the images, as they were set to the wrong time. The issue was fixed, I am disappointed that the Internet is required for this.

<b>Further context:</b>

I turned the Wi-Fi connection off on my Raspberry Pi last night, as I wanted to work without Internet. I found out the next day that the Raspberry Pi has no internal clock, and just continued from the shutdown at around 10:00 pm last night. However, I didn't fix it until I noticed the issue at 3:00 pm PST, when the clock hit midnight, over 4 hours after I started audio metadata additions. All images that date to a time before 2022 February 2nd at 1:00 am cannot be trusted for their creation date for this days entry. All images dating to 2022 February 2nd at 3:08 pm or later can be trusted for this days entry.

---

I re-enabled the Internet at around 3:00 pm, and added data for a large playlist of 124 items, although I only had to add data for 62 items (MP3 files) as I don't add metadata to OGG files. It still took me several hours. I kept pushing myself to do more and moreuntil Ifinished the task.

Today, I shut the Raspberry Pi down early before 8:00 pm, and began getting specialized end of session screenshots. I copied and bakced up the audio and image data from the SD card, I have yet to do a full backup.

I used my Raspberry Pi today to update a document. It was left idle for most of the day, but I broke my 8 day hiatus. I plan to get back into audio conversion tomorrow, and further update the document.

##### 2022 February 12th

<!-- Notes 2022.02.12

- [x] Website: Thingiverse is partially functional on the Raspberry Pi. Models can be viewed, and the site can be navigated, but downloading is impossible with normal usage.

I used my Raspberry Pi today to update a document and do audio conversion while I did other things. I started later in the day today (at around 5:00 pm) Today, a weird glitch happened under Chromiun, in which the browser claimed that DuckDuckGo was blocked. It functioned fine again after a reload of the page. I also tested the site Thingiverse, a site I have used in the past. It doesn't work fully on the Raspberry Pi, refusing to let me download. I am surprised that it even worked at all.

I did mostly audio conversion today. I shut down a few minutes before 1:00 am, the latest I have ever left it on to date.

I am also able to partially confirm what I originally thought was untrue, which is that the Raspberry Pi is not a good device for web browsing. I am not fully confirming it yet, as I still see it working, if I can get a better browser installed.

I used my Raspberry Pi today to add metadata to audio files, and didn't get to anything else after a partial amount of that was done. It was mostly left idle today.

##### 2022 February 14th

<!-- Notes 2022.02.14

- [x] Nothing new learnt today

I booted up my Raspberry Pi today, but didn't use it. I was originally going to add audio metadata today, but didn't have the time. I later considered updating the document I was working on, but decided against that too, and shut it down before 10:00 pm.

I am starting to consider attempting to get flagwaver to run on the Raspberry Pi, hopefully not in a way that requires Chromium, as I want to avoid it as much as I can (unfortunately, my Pi is refusing to let me install any other browsers, read previous entries for more info) I thought it would be a cool display for it, especially with non-official flags, such as a Nordic country flag (Iceland or Norway) I saw last night, which was modified to be in Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow, with the Nordic cross being white with a black outline.

I briefly used the Raspberry Pi today to edit a document, but left the device idle until about an hour after midnight.

##### 2022 February 18th

<!-- Notes 2022.02.17

- [x] Hardware:specific : The Raspberry Pi model has a loose connection and can have problems, even if it isn't moved. [not fully confirmed]

- [x] Nothing else learnt today

I tried to use my Raspberry Pi today to edit a document, but the device failed to boot 3 times in a row. I noticed that it had also been left on all night (it was shut down, but the Pi itself was still on) It booted for several seconds, then it lost signal. After doing this a 3rd time, I decided to shut the Pi down and manually retrieve the document.

I have been told that the model I have has a noted loose connection, and it can have a loose video signal, even if the device isn't manually moved. I am not able to confirm this yet though, although it seems likely, as this is a pretty random process, and I have seen it at least 7 times across 2 different Raspberry Pi devices so far (3 of those are from today)

- [x] Hardware:specific : The Raspberry Pi was repaired by unplugging and re-inserting all video cables.

- [x] Nothing else learnt today

I got my Raspberry Pi fixed this morning. It either corrected on its own or unplugging and plugging the video cables back in fixed it. I didn't use it too much today, I finished adding metadata for a playlist I have held off work on forover a week, but then left it idle for several hours, before finalizing and shutting down.

I used my Raspberry Pi to convert audio for 1 soundtrack while I did the weekly GitHub organization task set. It was a lot more time consuming than expected, and I didn't have as much time to work on converting audio. I was going to do more than just the Yandere Simulator soundtrack, but I ran out of time. 

##### 2022 February 26th

<!-- Notes 2022.02.26

- [x] The LXDE desktop has some basic UNIX desktop features. 2 notable ones I noted were menu options to roll up/down windows (normal appearance, vs. just the title bar) and also an `undecorate` option, which removes the menu bar, several parts of the titlebar, and other parts of the window. This isn't exclusive to the Raspberry Pi's operating system or even the LXDE desktop environment, but it is something not found on a typical Ubuntu installation.

I used my Raspberry Pi to parse metadata for 1 soundtrack while I did other things. I got sidetracked constantly, but had time to convert more audio, I just decided not to.

I am disappointed that I didn't get to use my Raspberry Pi today, as today was the 10 year anniversary of the project. I didn't know how to celebrate, and just didn't have the time.

I recently got a new Raspberry Pi accessory, but have not put it to use yet. It is an obscure offbrand item, but it works well. It is a Lego-like case that is meant to look like an NES, but due to restrictions, it doesn't have NES branding, or even Lego branding, although it is fully compatible with Lego. I will try to get a link for it if it still exists, it was going out of stock forever.

A cool thing about cases like this are the modifications you can make to it. For example, I had the idea to remove the bottom brick boards, and replace them with gate pieces to enable better circulation and subsequent cooling. It is so cool that you can do this. Since it is pretty much the same thing as Lego, lots of other customizations can be made too if needed.

I forgot to mention in yesterdays entry that the case was considered an early birthday present. I am starting to get interested in maxing out my desk area. I have recently learnt of these tubes that you can buy that go around the cords to prevent damage from being done to them.

Old, but needs revisit

- [x] 4K display: make it so I don't have to wear glasses AND strain my eyes to see what I am doing (I am really glad it is not an 8K or higher device because of this reason) In a nutshell: fix the display resolution (I have 2 1080p displays, so this wasn't an issue. I was using another device originally to test it. It will need to be looked at in the future though.)

Other things to do:

- [ ] Make a text corpus with as many languages as possible, with English labels, and test which ones are compatible with Raspberry Pi OS, and which ones aren't.

> Confirmed to work: Latin/English, Japanese, Chinese, Punjabi

> Confirmed to not work: Korean

- [ ] Test: what GitHub is like on the Raspberry Pi, and if I need to keep my sessions separate from each other [device independant]

> Progress: I can't even log in, as the current version of Chromium that comes with the Raspberry Pi isn't supported. When I figure out how to install another browser, I will try again.

## Known issues with external hardware

These are the known issues I haven't gotten to talking about until now. They are dependant on the external hardware I am using, and not the Raspberry Pi itself.

- [x] The Mouse freezes with every minute of inactivity, you have to click anywhere to wake it up (Don't know how to fix this)

- [x] The screen has low color quality

- [ ] No other known issues with my hardware

### Pie naming scheme

I came up with a creative file sorting mechanism for my Raspberry Pi, where every folder on the desktop will be named after a type of Pie, and will be dedicated to a certain category of files. Currently, there are 32 different flavors supported.

On 2022 January 18th, an `/Oven/` directory was created to store all the Pie directories.

### Ubuntu on Raspberry Pi goals

- [ ] Install the system successfully and keep the system installed for 7 days

- [ ] Delete Google Chrome and Google Chromium

- [ ] Make a lite setup for journaling and important tasks

#### Install tests

I have been experimenting with Ubuntu on Raspberry Pi. It hasn't been successful so far.

**Trial 1** `(2 tests)`

**Version:** `Ubuntu 21.04 (64 bit)`

**Attempts:** `5+ (on 2 different Raspberry PIs, on 2 different 32 gigabyte SanDIsk SD cards`

**Result:** `Complete system lockup, cannot get past desktop`

T1T1: Successfully installed, reached the desktop, immediate crash upon opening Nautilus, soft lock

T1T2: Restarted 4 times | first restart: stuck on desktop, screen 2 miscolored | second restart: stuck on installation screen, with no install window | third restart: got stuck on a screen with 3 out of 4 orange dots, with random Us and unknown characters on the screen | fourth restart: made it to desktop, with icons, skipped installation, system softlocked for a fourth time

Notes: The time is set to October for some reason, and the clock doesn't move, so I know it isn't just the keyboard and mouse being unresponsive.

T1T1 = Trial 1 Test 1 | T1T2 = Trial 1 Test 2

I am going to try a different version of Ubuntu next. I hope I can get Ubuntu to work, due to its app support, recognized API and interface, and stability, as my current laptop is badly failing, and I may need to use the Raspberry Pi as a backup until I can repair the keyboard for a second time.

## Daily status

I haven't gotten to use my Pi4 for a while. My current goal is to get the TV to stay on long enough first (and not have it shut down/go into sleep mode after every 15 minutes) it is hindering me from starting usage. - 2022 January 10th

I forgot to mention my Raspberry Pi game night on 2022 Saturday, January 8th. It was really fun, and I stayed up way too late (past 4 am) I didn't use my own Pi, but I plan to next time for the games.

I still haven't gotten to use my Pi recently. I am still bummed out about the sleep mode problem, and the fact that my Pi had to have a hard reset to resume usage. I was given a Ubuntu SD card, based on the experience of the other Raspberry Pi user in the house, it didn't go well, here is what happened:

* User2 used a 32 gigabyte SanDisk SD card with Ubuntu 21.04

* The installation went fine, but the moment he tried to use a file manager (I assume: GNOME Files/Nautilus) the system froze up completely (both keyboard and mouse unresponsive, frames per second: 0) and had to be hard reset

* It hasn't been attempted since. I have been given a fresh SD card to experiment with it on my own.

</details>

I fixed the sleep mode issue today on the TV without installing the evil operating system in full, now I just have to do it on each operating system setup.

Today, I tried to work on getting Ubuntu to set up, but failed. I didn't really use the Pi much today. Other than this, I learnt how to take out SD cards and put them into the Pi on my own, without much difficulty. - 2022 Thursday, January 13th

## Major plans

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</u></b></p></summary>

I have decided to make the Raspberry Pi my primary desktop computer class B. I just realized the full potential of having a Raspberry Pi, and it helps mitigate the device failures I have been having.

One major advantage is that I can store the entire operating system on an external medium, something I have never been able to do before, and have always wanted to do. This includes all program data, all system files, all user files, all configuration files, and the rest. I was never able to do this with my normal Windows or Ubuntu installations.

### Planned drives

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</u></b></p></summary>

These are my planned external drives for my Raspberry Pi setup. It's going to be a Swap-a-thon!

- [x] I have a default test drive (capacity: 128 gigabytes | type: SD card (durable) )

- [x] I have a RetroPie drive (capacity: 128 gigabytes | type: SD card (durable) )

- [ ] I plan to have a development drive, a device with tons of development tools installed for as many programming languages as possible. It will likely run Ubuntu due to Ubuntus great support for software libraries and packages.

- [ ] I plan to have a drive for SNU development, so I can resume development on the site with better potential.

- [ ] I plan to have a family photo drive, for family photos

- [ ] I plan to have an entertainment class W drive for specific leisure content.

- [ ] I plan to have a normal drive for normal system development and everyday tasks.

- [ ] I plan to have a music drive for my music collection.

- [ ] I plan to have a book drive for my digital books, and my WikiPDF collection

- [ ] I plan to have a Reddit drive for my Reddit saves.

- [ ] I plan to have a website collection drive for my useful website rips

- [ ] I plan to have a second gaming drive that is separate from the RetroPie

- [ ] I plan to have a virtual machine drive for virtual machine usage (first: test to see the performance of VirtualBox/Another VM Hypervisor in a dummy drive)

- [ ] No other planned drives at the moment

</details>

### Cost

I can easily have a 4 terabyte external hard drive as the system drive. There currently is no known laptop equivalent for this. A 4 terabyte hard drive is super cheap, I could buy 12 terabytes worth of storage for what the 1 terabyte solid state drive in my current laptop costs.

### Scratch development

<!-- I plan to get back into Scratch development and usage for graphic design, archival, testing, sampling, and reference. !--->

I have developed some Scratch projects on the Pi, including:

- [x] The first 6 versions of the Scratch Edition of the StealthGeo font [View them here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/StealthGeo_Font/tree/StealthGeo-main/Prototype/Scratch/2/)

I have noted that big projects, or possibly projects created with a different version of Scratch, are not compatible with the Electron version of Scratch that is pre-installed in the Raspberry Pi operating system.
