### Cost

I can easily have a 4 terabyte external hard drive as the system drive. There currently is no known laptop equivalent for this. A 4 terabyte hard drive is super cheap, I could buy 12 terabytes worth of storage for what the 1 terabyte solid state drive in my current laptop costs.

### Scratch development

I plan to get back into Scratch development and usage for graphic design, archival, testing, sampling, and reference.
