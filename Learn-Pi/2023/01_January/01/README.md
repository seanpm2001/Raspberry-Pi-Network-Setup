##### 2023 January 1st

Today was the first day of the new year, and I did not use my Raspberry Pi. I also felt like taking an extra day before updating my RPi blog again. I overestimated how hard it actually would be to transition to the next year for this project.

<!-- - [ ] Nothing yet. !-->

<!-- I didn't spend much time on these goals today, I will try to get to them another time. !-->

Old, but needs revisit

- [x] 4K display: make it so I don't have to wear glasses AND strain my eyes to see what I am doing (I am really glad it is not an 8K or higher device because of this reason) In a nutshell: fix the display resolution (I have 2 1080p displays, so this wasn't an issue. I was using another device originally to test it. It will need to be looked at in the future though.)

Other things to do:

- [ ] Make a text corpus with as many languages as possible, with English labels, and test which ones are compatible with Raspberry Pi OS, and which ones aren't.

> Confirmed to work: Latin/English, Japanese, Chinese, Punjabi

> Confirmed to not work: Korean

- [ ] Test: what GitHub is like on the Raspberry Pi, and if I need to keep my sessions separate from each other [device independant]

> Progress: I can't even log in, as the current version of Chromium that comes with the Raspberry Pi isn't supported. When I figure out how to install another browser, I will try again.

## Known issues with external hardware

These are the known issues I haven't gotten to talking about until now. They are dependant on the external hardware I am using, and not the Raspberry Pi itself.

- [x] The Mouse freezes with every minute of inactivity, you have to click anywhere to wake it up (Don't know how to fix this)

- [x] The screen has low color quality

- [ ] No other known issues with my hardware

## Daily status

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</u></b></p></summary>

I haven't gotten to use my Pi4 for a while. My current goal is to get the TV to stay on long enough first (and not have it shut down/go into sleep mode after every 15 minutes) it is hindering me from starting usage. - 2022 January 10th

I forgot to mention my Raspberry Pi game night on 2022 Saturday, January 8th. It was really fun, and I stayed up way too late (past 4 am) I didn't use my own Pi, but I plan to next time for the games.

I still haven't gotten to use my Pi recently. I am still bummed out about the sleep mode problem, and the fact that my Pi had to have a hard reset to resume usage. I was given a Ubuntu SD card, based on the experience of the other Raspberry Pi user in the house, it didn't go well, here is what happened:

* User2 used a 32 gigabyte SanDisk SD card with Ubuntu 21.04

* The installation went fine, but the moment he tried to use a file manager (I assume: GNOME Files/Nautilus) the system froze up completely (both keyboard and mouse unresponsive, frames per second: 0) and had to be hard reset

* It hasn't been attempted since. I have been given a fresh SD card to experiment with it on my own.

</details>

I fixed the sleep mode issue today on the TV without installing the evil operating system in full, now I just have to do it on each operating system setup.

Today, I tried to work on getting Ubuntu to set up, but failed. I didn't really use the Pi much today. Other than this, I learnt how to take out SD cards and put them into the Pi on my own, without much difficulty. - 2022 Thursday, January 13th

## Major plans

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</u></b></p></summary>

I have decided to make the Raspberry Pi my primary desktop computer class B. I just realized the full potential of having a Raspberry Pi, and it helps mitigate the device failures I have been having.

One major advantage is that I can store the entire operating system on an external medium, something I have never been able to do before, and have always wanted to do. This includes all program data, all system files, all user files, all configuration files, and the rest. I was never able to do this with my normal Windows or Ubuntu installations.

</details>

### Other plans

#### SD Card clone, Ruby, Scarlet Oven

I hope to eventually do an SD card clone of my Raspberry Pi. Once I do this, I am considering installing Ruby, and eventually getting Scarlet Oven to run on it. In the meantime, I hope to eventually get to adding audio metadata.

#### Reduce or keep monitor count of 2

I am considering building a desktop computer separate from the Raspberry Pi, and I am deciding whether the Raspberry Pi needs 2 monitors or not. The decision started on 2022, Thursday, September 29th <!-- But it was not logged until 2022, Friday, September 30th !-->

**Oppose:** The monitor for this new computer will be a touchscreen monitor. There likely won't be space for 3 monitors in this one area.

**Keep:** Certain tasks are good with 2 screenshots

~~**Compromise:** Switch between the 2 monitors on the Raspberry Pi and the new computer~~

#### Take the case off

The case is nice and decorative, but it makes it hard to take an SD card out, or put one in. As long as there is a fan attached, it should work fine without a case.

#### Better document my Raspberry Pi setup

**Raspberry Pi tour**

I plan to get videos and pictures, both on Ubuntu, and the Raspberry Pi itself of my digital Raspberry Pi setup, along with the hardware setup as well. I just need to tidy it up first.

#### Increase Scratch usage

I want to start using Scratch again for certain projects. I also want to see if I can get Scratch 3 to run on the Raspberry Pi.

### Software on my Raspberry Pi

<details><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section: software on my Raspberry Pi</u></b></p></summary>

This listing is a work in progress. I plan to list all of the software on my Raspberry Pi here, with pictures. Once I boot my Pi up again, I plan to work on this section. Several sections are done from memory, so the names aren't accurate for some of them. Additionally, many programs aren't listed yet.

// Create an integer variable that will store the number we get from the user
int myNum;

// Ask the user to type a number
printf("Type a number: \n");

// Get and save the number the user types
scanf("%d", &myNum);

// Output the number the user typed
printf("Your number is: %d", myNum);
```

I installed Gedit on my Raspberry Pi, as at the time of installation, it was my preferred Linux text editor. As of 2022, December 26th, it still is.

Google Chromium unfortunately came pre-installed on my Raspberry Pi, rather than another browser. I intend to keep it, but once I get a better browser (like Firefox) installed, Chromium is going to just lay dormant on the SD card that my Raspberry Pi currently uses.

I recently discovered this Raspberry Pi imaging software, and I installed it on 2022, Sunday, December 25th. I hope to get some use out of it in the future, it seems like the exact software that was used to image the SD card that I got with my RPi originally.

## Abandoned notes

Weekly Raspberry Pi day to be Wednesday or Thursday

I have ruled out the idea of a `Raspberry Pi laptop` as the performance wouldn't be good enough, and the hardware just isn't possible.

I have also grown more interest in a `developer chip` an SD card running Linux that can natively run as many programming languages as possible (this is a challenge, I can't even get Ubuntu to load on the Pi yet, but I eventually want to get a system that can run any programming language, even those that are a bit obscure, like Go! or Svelte (and other not as common languages))

Still no hyperlink for spill protection tubes (still can't remember the name)

LXDE is very ugly, but extremely inefficient | image overload didn't overload

Intend to update Raspberry Pi blog banner picture eventually

Power outage at some point earlier this week

## Uptime

### History

#### Streak ?

The Raspberry Pi was previously running continuously since 2022 Tuesday April 19th at 8:12 pm. On 2022, June 2nd, due to 2 power flickers, and the fact that I haven't actually used the Raspberry Pi in at least 2 weeks, I decided to shut down, thus ending the streak. It was a little bit depressing, but I will get back to it again eventually.

#### Records

**Uptime record:** 42.89 days (6 weeks, 0 days)

**Current uptime:** 0.00 days (0 weeks, 0 days) (as of 2022, August 23rd)

## Planned upgrades

### Dual-boot I

I have 2 bootable SD cards that my Raspberry Pi operates, one of them for productivity and general use, and one for gaming. It has been an inconvenience to take the SD card out and put another one in. It is already hard enough just to get the 1 SD card to boot every time. I feel a dual boot modification would be a good idea.

#### Blueprints

There will be a secondary SD card slot added to the Raspberry Pi. Upon booting the device, there will be a prompt to ask which system (SD card + system) to boot from. There might be some difficult software modifications needed to bring up a GRUB dualboot screen, possibly a 3rd storage device that isn't an SD card.

I am still unsure how I will get this to work. I am currently unsure if it is possible.

### Planned drives

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</u></b></p></summary>

These are my planned external drives for my Raspberry Pi setup. It's going to be a Swap-a-thon!

- [x] I have a default test drive (capacity: 128 gigabytes | type: SD card (durable) )

- [x] I have a RetroPie drive (capacity: 128 gigabytes | type: SD card (durable) )

- [ ] I plan to have a development drive, a device with tons of development tools installed for as many programming languages as possible. It will likely run Ubuntu due to Ubuntus great support for software libraries and packages.

- [ ] I plan to have a drive for SNU development, so I can resume development on the site with better potential.

- [ ] I plan to have a family photo drive, for family photos

- [ ] I plan to have an entertainment class W drive for specific leisure content.

- [ ] I plan to have a normal drive for normal system development and everyday tasks.

- [ ] I plan to have a music drive for my music collection.

- [ ] I plan to have a book drive for my digital books, and my WikiPDF collection

- [ ] I plan to have a Reddit drive for my Reddit saves.

- [ ] I plan to have a website collection drive for my useful website rips

- [ ] I plan to have a second gaming drive that is separate from the RetroPie

- [ ] I plan to have a virtual machine drive for virtual machine usage (first: test to see the performance of VirtualBox/Another VM Hypervisor in a dummy drive)

- [ ] No other planned drives at the moment

### Cost

I can easily have a 4 terabyte external hard drive as the system drive. There currently is no known laptop equivalent for this. A 4 terabyte hard drive is super cheap, I could buy 12 terabytes worth of storage for what the 1 terabyte solid state drive in my current laptop costs.

### Scratch development

<!-- I plan to get back into Scratch development and usage for graphic design, archival, testing, sampling, and reference. !--->

I have developed some Scratch projects on the Pi, including:

- [x] The first 6 versions of the Scratch Edition of the StealthGeo font [View them here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/StealthGeo_Font/tree/StealthGeo-main/Prototype/Scratch/2/)

I have noted that big projects, or possibly projects created with a different version of Scratch, are not compatible with the Electron version of Scratch that is pre-installed in the Raspberry Pi operating system.
