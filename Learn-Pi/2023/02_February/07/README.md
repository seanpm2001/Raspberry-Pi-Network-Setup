##### 2023 January 1st

Today was the first day of the new year, and I did not use my Raspberry Pi. I also felt like taking an extra day before updating my RPi blog again. I overestimated how hard it actually would be to transition to the next year for this project.

##### 2023 January 2nd

I am still waiting for the weather to get better, the backup power generator is going to help, but it may not be exactly what I want. I wanted a generator that could last the duration of a power outage, but I am getting one that will allow me to save everything and shut down instead. This is good, the only problem is if the power goes out while I am sleeping, and the outage drains the entire backup, which would cause a hard shutdown and data loss. It is still better than nothing. I don't think the Raspberry Pi would need that much power, but the monitors likely would. Maybe I should only hook 1 of the monitors to the backup.

I updated my Raspberry Pi blog for the first time this year. I assumed that it would be difficult, since I have to reconfigure my boilerplate template. It wasn't that difficult, and I now have the blog back up to date.

##### 2023 January 3rd

Nothing new with the Raspberry Pi today, but I had time to update the RPi blog today.

##### 2023 January 4th

Nothing new with the Raspberry Pi today, and no time to update the blog.

##### 2023 January 5th

<!-- Notes
New SD card arrived
Blog not updated
!-->

My newest 128 gigabyte SD arrived today, but I made no use of it today. I also failed to update my Raspberry Pi blog again today. I have plans for tomorrow though.

##### 2023 January 6th

<!-- Notes
Raspberry Pi 1 year anniversary
Raspberry Pi connected to battery backup, ~20 minute emergency shutdown time for the many devices connected to the backup
No boot problems, Pi booted up for first time in 2023
Audio conversion, 2 errors
Left Pi on all night
RetroPie 3rd imaged SD card created
Didn't have the time to update RPi blog
!-->

My Raspberry Pi was connected to a battery backup today, I had previously used the term "backup power generator" when I meant "battery backup" additionally, I thought today was the 1 year anniversary of my Raspberry Pi, but that is tomorrow.

I booted up my Raspberry Pi today for the first time in quite some time, and also for the first time in 2023. I did some audio conversion today, but ended up with 2 files not being created due to an error. I left the Raspberry Pi on all night.

Today, a 3rd RetroPie image was written, as multiple SD cards were purchased recently. They are fairly cheap nowadays, a durable, non-generic 128 gigabyte SD card is only about $20.00 (USD) there is a 2nd Raspberry Pi in the house, but I rarely mention it. I did not have time to update my Raspberry Pi blog today, although a lot happened today.

> **Note** Today is the 1 year anniversary of my Raspberry Pi

Today I successfully got Ubuntu 22.04.1 to install and run on Raspberry Pi B (2nd Raspberry Pi 4) after midnight, although it was extremely slow (there was a 0.5-2.5 second delay doing anything) and Firefox and the Ubuntu software store uninstalled themselves within minutes of installation for some reason. I was tempted to try Manjaro. After seeing how slow Ubuntu was on the Raspberry Pi, I decided to image Manjaro with KDE onto my SD card. Ubuntu can wait. This will also be my first time using KDE, which is what I originally wanted to use on Linux. The imaging process took less than 4 minutes.

It was very windy tonight, and I thought I might be able to make use of the battery backup. The power never went out.

I had to switch the input on my monitors back to HDMI1 after turning monitors back on. It was a bit annoying that they didn't stay on the same input after I turned them off for the night. It made me think my Raspberry Pi SD card was corrupted/damaged.

I found that there are so many options with the Raspberry Pi imager. I don't see how Ubuntu failed last time, it was the same SD card.

Later on in the day, I successfully wrote Manjaro onto the SD card, and recorded it. The video file is less than 3 megabytes and is nearly 4 minutes long, 1080p, with no quality loss. If only WebM was owned by someone else...

I have plasn to install Manjaro after my application screenshot project is done. I made very little use of the Pi today, and again failed to update my Raspberry Pi blog.

##### 2023 January 8th

<!-- Notes
RPI not used today
Plans to install Android, latest plan to get a backup of my phone, separate from the DeGoogled Android virtual machine project
Blog partially updated
!-->

I did not use my Raspberry Pi today, but I wanted to. I did finally get the Raspberry Pi blog mostly back up to date (excluding the most recent day, which was done on purpose, as something might happen in the last 3 hours of each day)

I came up with a major new plan today. I have been trying to get a DeGoogled Android virtual machine for a while, but for the time being, a DeGoogled Android SD card might be even better.

Some reasons for this include:

* Guaranteed portability
* Smaller backup sizes (won't have to create constant snapshots, thus saving terabytes of memory)

I plan to get Android running on my Raspberry Pi, and get all of my apps from my phone onto it. First, I need a 256 gigabyte SD card, which again, isn't that expensive in 2023.

The only concerns I have with it are:

* Possible slowness (RAM will be fine, as I have 8 gigabytes, but CPU/GPU usage may be a problem)
* Program compatibility issues (some, or many apps may not work due to anti-VM source code)
* The lack of a touchscreen (although Android can be used with a keyboard)

I first have to get screenshots of the Raspberry Pi OS, then try out Manjaro, then I will attempt to get the 256 gigabyte SD card and try this plan out.

##### 2023 January 9th

I kept my Raspberry Pi blog partially up to date today. I am having a 1 day buffer, as events may happen after I finish writing for the day. The Raspberry Pi was used after midnight on 2023, January 10th. I compiled a list of programs, and continued to sort the VLC playlist of recently converted audio. I have yet to try Manjaro or Android.

##### 2023 January 10th

<!--
Repository created for RPI-imager images
!-->

I kept my Raspberry Pi blog partially up to date again today, note the buffer mentioned on 2023, January 9th. I am slowly working on sorting a playlist of recently converted audio. I didn't make any progress on this today. I still have to get screenshots of programs, then I will try Manjaro/Android.

Today on GitHub, I created a repository for images of the Raspberry Pi imaging software.

##### 2023 January 11th

I could not work the Raspberry Pi into my schedule again today, but I did keep the blog partially up to date. I have set a deadline of 2023 January 31st to have the playlist I have been working on to be completely sorted, annotated, and published, although I hope to finish earlier than this.

##### 2023 January 12th

I could not work the Raspberry Pi into my schedule yet again today, but I did keep the blog partially up to date.

2023.01.14 Notes
Pros and cons of playlist exports (scrolling, resetting the order and having to restart organizing the playlist
Playlist organized and saved
Metadata exports come next
Raspberry Pi used for about an hour today
!-->

I used the Raspberry Pi today and finished working on the playlist I have been procrastinating on. There were some pros and cons during this time, I want to mention a problem specific to VLC and not the Raspberry Pi:

When moving entries in a playlist, the playlist scrolls while you are moving it, but upon placing it down where you want it (or not where you want it) you are thrown back down to where the entry originally was, causing you to have to scroll back up (or down) to see it. This isn't much of an issue in smaller playlists, but when you have a playlist that is 186 entries long, of which only less than 32 entries can be on the screen at once (and when you move items around many times) it gets rather annoying.

Additionally, I accidentally reset the order of the playlist in the beginning, so the little progress I made since 2023 January 6th was gone. I remade the whole playlist today and saved it. Exporting the metadata comes next, then program screenshots, then I plan to try out Manjaro, then (if Manjaro performance is good) I will try Android.

I used my Raspberry Pi for about an hour today. I have to admit, LXDE has grown on me. I don't know if it is the weird colors of the monitors I have, or something with the desktop environment, but I was really nostalgic towards the environment my Raspberry Pi is in. I also kept my Raspberry Pi blog partially up to date today.

2023.01.15 notes
1 week of metadata (goal)
!-->

I had plans to start doing daily metadata writing on my Raspberry Pi, as part of the current project. I had a pretty difficult day today personally, and never got the time for it today. I had set a low bar for myself (only 14 files per day, which would let me finish the project within 7 days if done consecutively) the monitors were never turned on, the Raspberry Pi just ran idle.

I decided to update my blog past what I have been currently doing (holding 1 day off each day) I also did a remodel to the header, as part of my recent discovery on 2023, January 15th of how to center text in Markdown. It is extremely easy to do, and this blog file now contains a pretty decent chunk of my Markdown knowledge. It also makes the blog look prettier (in my opinion) additionally, I added blank entries for all of 2023, March.

##### 2023 January 16th

New schedule
!-->

I did not make time to fit Raspberry Pi usage into my schedule today. Additionally, I am under a stricter schedule now, so for the meantime, there won't be any after midnight sessions. This also helps with the blog, which I updated today.

##### 2023 January 17th

<!--

As of 8:20 pm today, I used my Raspberry Pi briefly to redownload the cover art in preparation for metadata writing. I am likely to use the Raspberry Pi briefly before going to bed, but I can't update my blog that late. If I get to metadata work, I will write it in here:

I got to work on audio conversion tonight, but it was very slow. I also messed up and added metadata for an OGG file, and found that you can't remove cover art in VLC. I will either have to re-convert this file, or find another way to scrub metadata. When not counting the error, I only added metadata for 5 files today.

I updated my Raspberry Pi blog today. I still really like the work I did on centering the header of the blog recently.

##### 2023 January 18th

As of 7:25 pm today, I have not used my Raspberry Pi yet. I may have time to use it before bed, but I can't update my blog that late. If I get to metadata work, I will write it in here:

I did not get to metadata work tonight.

Same as yesterday. Although it was a bit tedious naming files last night (because I wasn't used to the posture) hopefully tonight will be better. Last night, it took time to figure out that screenshots were stored in the `home` directory and not the `pictures` or `screenshots` directories. Additionally, I found by accident that you can delete the entire Raspberry Pi folder with little questions asked. I almost did so by accident.

I updated my Raspberry Pi blog again today.

<!-- I didn't spend much time on these goals today, I will try to get to them another time. !-->

Old, but needs revisit

- [x] 4K display: make it so I don't have to wear glasses AND strain my eyes to see what I am doing (I am really glad it is not an 8K or higher device because of this reason) In a nutshell: fix the display resolution (I have 2 1080p displays, so this wasn't an issue. I was using another device originally to test it. It will need to be looked at in the future though.)

Other things to do:

- [ ] Make a text corpus with as many languages as possible, with English labels, and test which ones are compatible with Raspberry Pi OS, and which ones aren't.

> Confirmed to work: Latin/English, Japanese, Chinese, Punjabi

> Confirmed to not work: Korean

- [ ] Test: what GitHub is like on the Raspberry Pi, and if I need to keep my sessions separate from each other [device independant]

> Progress: I can't even log in, as the current version of Chromium that comes with the Raspberry Pi isn't supported. When I figure out how to install another browser, I will try again.

## Known issues with external hardware

These are the known issues I haven't gotten to talking about until now. They are dependant on the external hardware I am using, and not the Raspberry Pi itself.

- [x] The Mouse freezes with every minute of inactivity, you have to click anywhere to wake it up (Don't know how to fix this)

- [x] The screen has low color quality

- [ ] No other known issues with my hardware

## Daily status

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</u></b></p></summary>

I haven't gotten to use my Pi4 for a while. My current goal is to get the TV to stay on long enough first (and not have it shut down/go into sleep mode after every 15 minutes) it is hindering me from starting usage. - 2022 January 10th

I forgot to mention my Raspberry Pi game night on 2022 Saturday, January 8th. It was really fun, and I stayed up way too late (past 4 am) I didn't use my own Pi, but I plan to next time for the games.

I still haven't gotten to use my Pi recently. I am still bummed out about the sleep mode problem, and the fact that my Pi had to have a hard reset to resume usage. I was given a Ubuntu SD card, based on the experience of the other Raspberry Pi user in the house, it didn't go well, here is what happened:

* User2 used a 32 gigabyte SanDisk SD card with Ubuntu 21.04

* The installation went fine, but the moment he tried to use a file manager (I assume: GNOME Files/Nautilus) the system froze up completely (both keyboard and mouse unresponsive, frames per second: 0) and had to be hard reset

* It hasn't been attempted since. I have been given a fresh SD card to experiment with it on my own.

</details>

I fixed the sleep mode issue today on the TV without installing the evil operating system in full, now I just have to do it on each operating system setup.

Today, I tried to work on getting Ubuntu to set up, but failed. I didn't really use the Pi much today. Other than this, I learnt how to take out SD cards and put them into the Pi on my own, without much difficulty. - 2022 Thursday, January 13th

## Major plans

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</u></b></p></summary>

I have decided to make the Raspberry Pi my primary desktop computer class B. I just realized the full potential of having a Raspberry Pi, and it helps mitigate the device failures I have been having.

One major advantage is that I can store the entire operating system on an external medium, something I have never been able to do before, and have always wanted to do. This includes all program data, all system files, all user files, all configuration files, and the rest. I was never able to do this with my normal Windows or Ubuntu installations.

</details>

### Other plans

#### SD Card clone, Ruby, Scarlet Oven

I hope to eventually do an SD card clone of my Raspberry Pi. Once I do this, I am considering installing Ruby, and eventually getting Scarlet Oven to run on it. In the meantime, I hope to eventually get to adding audio metadata.

#### Reduce or keep monitor count of 2

I am considering building a desktop computer separate from the Raspberry Pi, and I am deciding whether the Raspberry Pi needs 2 monitors or not. The decision started on 2022, Thursday, September 29th <!-- But it was not logged until 2022, Friday, September 30th !-->

**Oppose:** The monitor for this new computer will be a touchscreen monitor. There likely won't be space for 3 monitors in this one area.

**Keep:** Certain tasks are good with 2 screenshots

~~**Compromise:** Switch between the 2 monitors on the Raspberry Pi and the new computer~~

#### Take the case off

The case is nice and decorative, but it makes it hard to take an SD card out, or put one in. As long as there is a fan attached, it should work fine without a case.

#### Better document my Raspberry Pi setup

**Raspberry Pi tour**

I plan to get videos and pictures, both on Ubuntu, and the Raspberry Pi itself of my digital Raspberry Pi setup, along with the hardware setup as well. I just need to tidy it up first.

#### Increase Scratch usage

I want to start using Scratch again for certain projects. I also want to see if I can get Scratch 3 to run on the Raspberry Pi.

**The sample C program:**

```c
// Program source: W3Schools, : https://www.w3schools.com/c/c_user_input.php
// Create an integer variable that will store the number we get from the user
int myNum;

// Ask the user to type a number
printf("Type a number: \n");

// Get and save the number the user types
scanf("%d", &myNum);

// Output the number the user typed
printf("Your number is: %d", myNum);
```

I installed Gedit on my Raspberry Pi, as at the time of installation, it was my preferred Linux text editor. As of 2022, December 26th, it still is.

Google Chromium unfortunately came pre-installed on my Raspberry Pi, rather than another browser. I intend to keep it, but once I get a better browser (like Firefox) installed, Chromium is going to just lay dormant on the SD card that my Raspberry Pi currently uses.

## Abandoned notes

Weekly Raspberry Pi day to be Wednesday or Thursday

I have ruled out the idea of a `Raspberry Pi laptop` as the performance wouldn't be good enough, and the hardware just isn't possible.

I have also grown more interest in a `developer chip` an SD card running Linux that can natively run as many programming languages as possible (this is a challenge, I can't even get Ubuntu to load on the Pi yet, but I eventually want to get a system that can run any programming language, even those that are a bit obscure, like Go! or Svelte (and other not as common languages))

Still no hyperlink for spill protection tubes (still can't remember the name)

LXDE is very ugly, but extremely inefficient | image overload didn't overload

Intend to update Raspberry Pi blog banner picture eventually

Power outage at some point earlier this week

***

## Uptime

### History

#### Streak ?

The Raspberry Pi was previously running continuously since 2022 Tuesday April 19th at 8:12 pm. On 2022, June 2nd, due to 2 power flickers, and the fact that I haven't actually used the Raspberry Pi in at least 2 weeks, I decided to shut down, thus ending the streak. It was a little bit depressing, but I will get back to it again eventually.

#### Records

**Uptime record:** 42.89 days (6 weeks, 0 days)

**Current uptime:** 0.00 days (0 weeks, 0 days) (as of 2022, August 23rd)

***

## Planned upgrades

### Dual-boot I

I have 2 bootable SD cards that my Raspberry Pi operates, one of them for productivity and general use, and one for gaming. It has been an inconvenience to take the SD card out and put another one in. It is already hard enough just to get the 1 SD card to boot every time. I feel a dual boot modification would be a good idea.

#### Blueprints

There will be a secondary SD card slot added to the Raspberry Pi. Upon booting the device, there will be a prompt to ask which system (SD card + system) to boot from. There might be some difficult software modifications needed to bring up a GRUB dualboot screen, possibly a 3rd storage device that isn't an SD card.

I am still unsure how I will get this to work. I am currently unsure if it is possible.

### Planned drives

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</u></b></p></summary>

These are my planned external drives for my Raspberry Pi setup. It's going to be a Swap-a-thon!

- [x] I have a default test drive (capacity: 128 gigabytes | type: SD card (durable) )

- [x] I have a RetroPie drive (capacity: 128 gigabytes | type: SD card (durable) )

- [ ] I plan to have a development drive, a device with tons of development tools installed for as many programming languages as possible. It will likely run Ubuntu due to Ubuntus great support for software libraries and packages.

- [ ] I plan to have a drive for SNU development, so I can resume development on the site with better potential.

- [ ] I plan to have a family photo drive, for family photos

- [ ] I plan to have an entertainment class W drive for specific leisure content.

- [ ] I plan to have a normal drive for normal system development and everyday tasks.

- [ ] I plan to have a music drive for my music collection.

- [ ] I plan to have a book drive for my digital books, and my WikiPDF collection

- [ ] I plan to have a Reddit drive for my Reddit saves.

- [ ] I plan to have a website collection drive for my useful website rips

- [ ] I plan to have a second gaming drive that is separate from the RetroPie

- [ ] I plan to have a virtual machine drive for virtual machine usage (first: test to see the performance of VirtualBox/Another VM Hypervisor in a dummy drive)

- [ ] No other planned drives at the moment

</details>

### Cost

I can easily have a 4 terabyte external hard drive as the system drive. There currently is no known laptop equivalent for this. A 4 terabyte hard drive is super cheap, I could buy 12 terabytes worth of storage for what the 1 terabyte solid state drive in my current laptop costs.

### Scratch development

<!-- I plan to get back into Scratch development and usage for graphic design, archival, testing, sampling, and reference. !--->

I have developed some Scratch projects on the Pi, including:

- [x] The first 6 versions of the Scratch Edition of the StealthGeo font [View them here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/StealthGeo_Font/tree/StealthGeo-main/Prototype/Scratch/2/)

I have noted that big projects, or possibly projects created with a different version of Scratch, are not compatible with the Electron version of Scratch that is pre-installed in the Raspberry Pi operating system.
