## [Daily blog entries](#Daily-blog-entries)

### [2023 January 1st](#2023-January-1st)

Today was the first day of the new year, and I did not use my Raspberry Pi. I also felt like taking an extra day before updating my RPi blog again. I overestimated how hard it actually would be to transition to the next year for this project.

### [2023 January 2nd](#2023-January-2nd)

I am still waiting for the weather to get better, the backup power generator is going to help, but it may not be exactly what I want. I wanted a generator that could last the duration of a power outage, but I am getting one that will allow me to save everything and shut down instead. This is good, the only problem is if the power goes out while I am sleeping, and the outage drains the entire backup, which would cause a hard shutdown and data loss. It is still better than nothing. I don't think the Raspberry Pi would need that much power, but the monitors likely would. Maybe I should only hook 1 of the monitors to the backup.

I updated my Raspberry Pi blog for the first time this year. I assumed that it would be difficult, since I have to reconfigure my boilerplate template. It wasn't that difficult, and I now have the blog back up to date.

### [2023 January 3rd](#2023-January-3rd)

Nothing new with the Raspberry Pi today, but I had time to update the RPi blog today.

### [2023 January 4th](#2023-January-4th)

Nothing new with the Raspberry Pi today, and no time to update the blog.

### [2023 January 5th](#2023-January-5th)

<!-- Notes
New SD card arrived
Blog not updated
!-->

My newest 128 gigabyte SD arrived today, but I made no use of it today. I also failed to update my Raspberry Pi blog again today. I have plans for tomorrow though.

### [2023 January 6th](#2023-January-6th)

<!-- Notes
Raspberry Pi 1 year anniversary
Raspberry Pi connected to battery backup, ~20 minute emergency shutdown time for the many devices connected to the backup
No boot problems, Pi booted up for first time in 2023
Audio conversion, 2 errors
Left Pi on all night
RetroPie 3rd imaged SD card created
Didn't have the time to update RPi blog
!-->

My Raspberry Pi was connected to a battery backup today, I had previously used the term "backup power generator" when I meant "battery backup" additionally, I thought today was the 1 year anniversary of my Raspberry Pi, but that is tomorrow.

I booted up my Raspberry Pi today for the first time in quite some time, and also for the first time in 2023. I did some audio conversion today, but ended up with 2 files not being created due to an error. I left the Raspberry Pi on all night.

Today, a 3rd RetroPie image was written, as multiple SD cards were purchased recently. They are fairly cheap nowadays, a durable, non-generic 128 gigabyte SD card is only about $20.00 (USD) there is a 2nd Raspberry Pi in the house, but I rarely mention it. I did not have time to update my Raspberry Pi blog today, although a lot happened today.

### [2023 January 7th](#2023-January-7th)

<!-- Notes
Successfully got Ubuntu 22.04.1 to install and run on Raspberry Pi B (2nd Raspberry Pi 4) although extremely slow, and Firefox and the Ubuntu software store uninstalled within minutes of installation for some reason
Tempted to try Manjaro, will first get 1 SD card running Ubuntu (128 GB) then a smaller one with Manjaro
Very windy tonight, might make use of battery backup
Input switched from HDMI1 upon turning monitors back on, a bit annoying that they didn't stay on the same input after I turned them off for the night. It made me think my Raspberry Pi SD card was corrupted/damaged
So many options with RPi imager
Successfully wrote Manjaro onto SD card, recorded it, video file is less than 3 megabytes and is nearly 4 minutes long, 1080p, with no quality loss. If only WebM was owned by someone else
Plans to install Manjaro after my application screensot project

> **Note** Today is the 1 year anniversary of my Raspberry Pi

Today I successfully got Ubuntu 22.04.1 to install and run on Raspberry Pi B (2nd Raspberry Pi 4) after midnight, although it was extremely slow (there was a 0.5-2.5 second delay doing anything) and Firefox and the Ubuntu software store uninstalled themselves within minutes of installation for some reason. I was tempted to try Manjaro. After seeing how slow Ubuntu was on the Raspberry Pi, I decided to image Manjaro with KDE onto my SD card. Ubuntu can wait. This will also be my first time using KDE, which is what I originally wanted to use on Linux. The imaging process took less than 4 minutes.

It was very windy tonight, and I thought I might be able to make use of the battery backup. The power never went out.

I had to switch the input on my monitors back to HDMI1 after turning monitors back on. It was a bit annoying that they didn't stay on the same input after I turned them off for the night. It made me think my Raspberry Pi SD card was corrupted/damaged.

I found that there are so many options with the Raspberry Pi imager. I don't see how Ubuntu failed last time, it was the same SD card.

Later on in the day, I successfully wrote Manjaro onto the SD card, and recorded it. The video file is less than 3 megabytes and is nearly 4 minutes long, 1080p, with no quality loss. If only WebM was owned by someone else...

I have plasn to install Manjaro after my application screenshot project is done. I made very little use of the Pi today, and again failed to update my Raspberry Pi blog.

<!-- Notes
RPI not used today
Plans to install Android, latest plan to get a backup of my phone, separate from the DeGoogled Android virtual machine project
Blog partially updated
!-->

I did not use my Raspberry Pi today, but I wanted to. I did finally get the Raspberry Pi blog mostly back up to date (excluding the most recent day, which was done on purpose, as something might happen in the last 3 hours of each day)

I came up with a major new plan today. I have been trying to get a DeGoogled Android virtual machine for a while, but for the time being, a DeGoogled Android SD card might be even better.

Some reasons for this include:

* Guaranteed portability
* Smaller backup sizes (won't have to create constant snapshots, thus saving terabytes of memory)

I plan to get Android running on my Raspberry Pi, and get all of my apps from my phone onto it. First, I need a 256 gigabyte SD card, which again, isn't that expensive in 2023.

The only concerns I have with it are:

* Possible slowness (RAM will be fine, as I have 8 gigabytes, but CPU/GPU usage may be a problem)
* Program compatibility issues (some, or many apps may not work due to anti-VM source code)
* The lack of a touchscreen (although Android can be used with a keyboard)

I first have to get screenshots of the Raspberry Pi OS, then try out Manjaro, then I will attempt to get the 256 gigabyte SD card and try this plan out.

### [2023 January 9th](#2023-January-9th)

I kept my Raspberry Pi blog partially up to date today. I am having a 1 day buffer, as events may happen after I finish writing for the day. The Raspberry Pi was used after midnight on 2023, January 10th. I compiled a list of programs, and continued to sort the VLC playlist of recently converted audio. I have yet to try Manjaro or Android.

### [2023 January 10th](#2023-January-10th)

Repository created for RPI-imager images

I kept my Raspberry Pi blog partially up to date again today, note the buffer mentioned on 2023, January 9th. I am slowly working on sorting a playlist of recently converted audio. I didn't make any progress on this today. I still have to get screenshots of programs, then I will try Manjaro/Android.

Today on GitHub, I created a repository for images of the Raspberry Pi imaging software.

### [2023 January 11th](#2023-January-11th)

I could not work the Raspberry Pi into my schedule again today, but I did keep the blog partially up to date. I have set a deadline of 2023 January 31st to have the playlist I have been working on to be completely sorted, annotated, and published, although I hope to finish earlier than this.

### [2023 January 12th](#2023-January-12th)

I could not work the Raspberry Pi into my schedule yet again today, but I did keep the blog partially up to date.

Pros and cons of playlist exports (scrolling, resetting the order and having to restart organizing the playlist
Playlist organized and saved
Metadata exports come next
Raspberry Pi used for about an hour today
!-->

I used the Raspberry Pi today and finished working on the playlist I have been procrastinating on. There were some pros and cons during this time, I want to mention a problem specific to VLC and not the Raspberry Pi:

When moving entries in a playlist, the playlist scrolls while you are moving it, but upon placing it down where you want it (or not where you want it) you are thrown back down to where the entry originally was, causing you to have to scroll back up (or down) to see it. This isn't much of an issue in smaller playlists, but when you have a playlist that is 186 entries long, of which only less than 32 entries can be on the screen at once (and when you move items around many times) it gets rather annoying.

Additionally, I accidentally reset the order of the playlist in the beginning, so the little progress I made since 2023 January 6th was gone. I remade the whole playlist today and saved it. Exporting the metadata comes next, then program screenshots, then I plan to try out Manjaro, then (if Manjaro performance is good) I will try Android.

I used my Raspberry Pi for about an hour today. I have to admit, LXDE has grown on me. I don't know if it is the weird colors of the monitors I have, or something with the desktop environment, but I was really nostalgic towards the environment my Raspberry Pi is in. I also kept my Raspberry Pi blog partially up to date today.

1 week of metadata (goal)
!-->

I had plans to start doing daily metadata writing on my Raspberry Pi, as part of the current project. I had a pretty difficult day today personally, and never got the time for it today. I had set a low bar for myself (only 14 files per day, which would let me finish the project within 7 days if done consecutively) the monitors were never turned on, the Raspberry Pi just ran idle.

I decided to update my blog past what I have been currently doing (holding 1 day off each day) I also did a remodel to the header, as part of my recent discovery on 2023, January 15th of how to center text in Markdown. It is extremely easy to do, and this blog file now contains a pretty decent chunk of my Markdown knowledge. It also makes the blog look prettier (in my opinion) additionally, I added blank entries for all of 2023, March.

New schedule

I did not make time to fit Raspberry Pi usage into my schedule today. Additionally, I am under a stricter schedule now, so for the meantime, there won't be any after midnight sessions. This also helps with the blog, which I updated today.

As of 8:20 pm today, I used my Raspberry Pi briefly to redownload the cover art in preparation for metadata writing. I am likely to use the Raspberry Pi briefly before going to bed, but I can't update my blog that late. If I get to metadata work, I will write it in here:

I got to work on audio conversion tonight, but it was very slow. I also messed up and added metadata for an OGG file, and found that you can't remove cover art in VLC. I will either have to re-convert this file, or find another way to scrub metadata. When not counting the error, I only added metadata for 5 files today.

I updated my Raspberry Pi blog today. I still really like the work I did on centering the header of the blog recently.

I did not get to metadata work tonight.

Same as yesterday. Although it was a bit tedious naming files last night (because I wasn't used to the posture) hopefully tonight will be better. Last night, it took time to figure out that screenshots were stored in the `home` directory and not the `pictures` or `screenshots` directories. Additionally, I found by accident that you can delete the entire Raspberry Pi folder with little questions asked. I almost did so by accident.

I updated my Raspberry Pi blog again today.

It has been running idle for weeks, I am worried about it, and am considering a shutdown without converting the audio. I really hope to get to it again soon, maybe I can find the time again next week. I just recovered from a severe problem, and have had schedule issues for quite some time, but I hope to change this.

### [2023 February 3rd](#2023-February-3rd)

I did not use my Raspberry Pi today, but I did update my Raspberry Pi blog. There was a city-wide power flicker today, I am really glad to have my battery backup, as I don't know what would have happened to my Raspberry Pi if it did go out.

### [2023 February 4th](#2023-February-4th)

I did not use my Raspberry Pi today, but I did update my Raspberry Pi blog. I have just recently remembered the 2023 January 31st deadline, it is 4 days past, and I don't see myself making time for it anytime soon.

I am preparing to shut down my Raspberry Pi without finishing the current task, and I held it off again today. This is now becoming a repeating problem as well. I have a lot more time today, so I plan to try and shut down after midnight. If I succeed, I will write about it tomorrow, if not, ditto.

### [2023 February 17th](#2023-February-17th)

I finally shut my Raspberry Pi down last night. The playlist has been postponed. Next time I get back on it, I intend to do the documentation task, then I will attempt to boot Manjaro. I have been developing plans for a server image, and once these plans finish formulation, I intend to run a very small local server off of my Raspberry Pi. I did update my Raspberry Pi blog today after a major 2+ hour GitHub outage.

### [2023 February 18th](#2023-February-18th)

I had a lot of available time today, the day after I finally shut the Raspberry Pi down. I had issues sleeping last night, so I don't intend to use it tonight, instead I plan to go to bed earlier. I did update my Raspberry Pi blog today as a final GitHub commit task for today.

I did not use my Raspberry Pi yet again today, but I did update my Raspberry Pi blog for a second consecutive day. I would like to note that if there is a delay on getting home from my upcoming vacation, the Raspberry Pi dual boot project may be delayed by a day, but I will still try to get some work done on it. I am fearful of this, as it will throw off most of my schedule. The latest I will start the RPi dual boot project is 2023, Wednesday, March 15th.

### [2023 March 1st](#2023-March-1st)

I did not use my Raspberry Pi yet again today, but I did update the Raspberry Pi blog for a 3rd consecutive day. I had so much free time yesterday that I considered getting Raspberry Pi screenshots. Instead, I had lots of procrastination time. I was trying to do something with that time, but I failed. Maybe another day?

### [2023 March 2nd](#2023-March-2nd)

I did not use my Raspberry Pi yet again today, but I did update the Raspberry Pi blog for a 4th consecutive day. I converted audio on my laptop last night and also today, and have found that the conversion speed is superior to that of the Raspberry Pi. For some reason, it initially felt like they were the same, I must not have been paying attention. I was able to convert 12 hours of audio within 40 minutes (~6 hours MP3, ~6 hours OGG) I think I will convert audio on the laptop rather than the Raspberry Pi from now on. This will additionally free up usage opportunities and time for the Raspberry Pi.

### [2023 March 25th](#2023-March-25th)

I did not use my Raspberry Pi yet again today, but I did update the Raspberry Pi blog for a 25th consecutive day, despite there being nothing to write about. Work on the BerryBoot project is paused still. Scarlet Oven received a new documentation repository today: [:octocat: `Scarlet Oven Docs`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Scarlet-Oven_Docs/)

Today was a very difficult day, but an important change was made that is estimated to reduce ~2-4 hours of work per day. I had to do it today, as I was stretched past my limit, and I finally decided that it was time for this to go. I may have time for the Raspberry Pi again, but due to this new computer, this might divert even more time away from the Raspberry Pi. I may be able to split it half and half, but I don't see this as likely.

### [2023 March 26th](#2023-March-26th)

I did not use my Raspberry Pi yet again today, but I did update the Raspberry Pi blog for a 26th consecutive day, despite there being nothing to write about. Work on the BerryBoot and Scarlet Oven projects is currently paused. I did set up Windows 10 on the new computer due to the request of a family member (just so it is installed) it is going to swapped out with another hard drive in a few days, where Ubuntu will be installed. I am mentioning this computer, as it is part of the Raspberry Pi workstation area, and shares outlets with the Raspberry Pi now (not at the same time of course)

Work on the BerryBoot and Scarlet Oven projects is currently paused. I am still recovering from the loss of Guinea. To make things worse, my laptop had its second kernel panic last night at around 1:30 am, and refused to turn back on until the next day. I am told kernel panics indicate hardware failure, I am hoping this isn't the case. This laptop still isn't even a year old yet. Unlike last time, I had all of my important work saved, so all that was lost were my 3 VLC playlists for the day, which I might be able to partially recover via recreation, as it wasn't a very complex set of playlists.

I couldn't use my Raspberry Pi today even if I wanted to, as I lost over 2 hours of time due to a severe technical issue. My computer had a drive problem, and I got to use `fsck` for the first time. It was a very difficult 40+ minutes, trying to figure out what to do, but I was eventually able to get the operating system to boot again, instead of dropping into BusyBox, all without having to send my computer in for repair. It felt really empowering, but it led to a lot of problems. I plan to do a full hard drive backup tomorrow, so that will take a lot more time. Nothing was lost this time, not even a playlist (the playlist was in my memory, and was easy to recreate)

### [2023 June 14th](#2023-June-14th)

I went and booted up my Raspberry Pi today, but didn't use it. I have had lots of time today due to a recent kernel panic last night that forced me back to my XPS 13, cutting me off from my journal for the day, along with one other project. Unfortunately, having to use 2 keyboards at once, due to a broken keyboard bogged me down significantly. I plan to try and use the Raspberry Pi tomorrow. I also updated the Raspberry Pi blog for a 106th consecutive day. I hope to eventually regain access to the files on my Pangolin.

### [2023 June 15th](#2023-June-15th)

My Raspberry Pi was left idle today. I wanted to use it, but I had a dentist appointment, was a bit distracted, and am also severely bogged down by having to use 2 keyboards at once. Until I can get a system repair, or a computer with no hardware input problems, I might have to cut lots of leisure activities and get less sleep. The Raspberry Pi unfortunately isn't a backup option, as it is too low spec, and isn't capable of getting a web browser that is new enough to access GitHub. I also updated the Raspberry Pi blog for a 107th consecutive day. I hope to eventually regain access to the files on my Pangolin. It is being sent back to the manufacturer for repair soon.

### [2023 June 16th](#2023-June-16th)

My Raspberry Pi was left idle today. I made plans to use it after midnight, but I want to just relax tonight note. Here were my planned session notes for when I resume.

So my System76 Pangolin was fixed today, it booted successfully with no errors. I didn't even need to run the `fsck` command. I have no idea what caused it to turn back on, maybe nearly 48 hours of not being touched fixed it. I was given a second chance, so I screwed up my workload to do something more important: back up everything! It is all backed up now. It might still be shipped to System76, but I am extremely grateful and relieved to have all of my data. I am likely not going to continue work on it for a while. Based on the system logs, GIMP may have brought the system down, as it repeatedly gave the system errors, and was the last error before the kernel panic.

### [2023 June 17th](#2023-June-17th)

I was unable to use my Raspberry Pi again today, so it was left idle. I had to get caught back up today, and will likely want to relax instead of using the Raspberry Pi. I have to do some file retrieval tomorrow as well, but I shouldn't be as busy. I did update my Raspberry Pi blog today.

### [2023 June 18th](#2023-June-18th)

I was unable to use my Raspberry Pi yet again today, so it was left idle. I am still working on getting everything going again, and will likely want to relax instead of using the Raspberry Pi.

I was unable to use my Raspberry Pi yet again today, so it was left idle yet again. I am still working on getting everything going again, and will likely want to relax instead of using the Raspberry Pi. I had some available time today, but decided not to use my Raspberry Pi. I am additionally working on formatting a hard drive, so that I can put it into a computer for use in data backups. My schedule shouldn't return back to normal until tomorrow, but Raspberry Pi usage might not immediately return. I did update my Raspberry Pi blog today.

I was unable to use my Raspberry Pi yet again today, so it was left idle yet again. I am still working on getting everything going again, and will likely want to relax instead of using the Raspberry Pi. 

I didn't have available time today, my keyboard is severely bogging down my time, although I made significant progress in short time. Later on, I had to skip my journal, and fall behind on some work, due to a 1 hour break, and also over 2 hours of tension over the events in Russia (see: Wagner Mutiny and also: Russian Revolutions of 1917)

I finished getting caught back up on 4 repositories today, which was a big accomplishment for me. I am additionally working on formatting a hard drive, so that I can put it into a computer for use in data backups. I am still having difficulty getting it to read. I am now considering plugging it into the Raspberry Pi to see if it recognizes it, as both of my laptops can run it, but can't read from it or access it. I am planning on beginning to make use of my Raspberry Pis 4 USB ports as well, with plans to put a USB hub in to reduce port usage by 1 to 2. I did update my Raspberry Pi blog today.

The mouse died since I last used it, so I had to replace the battery, as I unfortunately don't have rechargable batteries for the mouse.

I am additionally working on formatting a hard drive, so that I can put it into a computer for use in data backups. I am still having difficulty getting it to read. I am now considering plugging it into the Raspberry Pi to see if it recognizes it, as both of my laptops can run it, but can't read from it or access it. I am planning on beginning to make use of my Raspberry Pis 4 USB ports as well, with plans to put a USB hub in to reduce port usage by 1 to 2. I did update my Raspberry Pi blog today.

### [2023 June 28th](#2023-June-28th)

I was unable to use my Raspberry Pi today, so it was left idle. I am trying to find the time for it, and will likely want to relax instead of using the Raspberry Pi tonight. I have plans to divide work up, so that some documents stay on the Raspberry Pi, as this current laptop situation isn't going very smoothly (8 gigabytes of RAM really should be enough, but Ubuntu is so bloated, that it is worse than Windows 10 in this aspect. With Firefox open, memory leaks cause my system to run out of memory within 1-5 hours of usage)

I was unable to use my Raspberry Pi today, so it was left idle. I am trying to find the time for it, and will likely want to relax instead of using the Raspberry Pi tonight. I have plans to divide work up, so that some documents stay on the Raspberry Pi. Preparations are currently under way.

I am likely going to have to shut my Raspberry Pi down on Saturday, and possibly even Sunday, due to very high winds in the forecast, and because I am doing a hard drive backup on Friday, and possibly Saturday and Sunday as well (depending on how long it takes) and I need to prioritize my battery backup towards that.

### [2023 June 30th](#2023-June-30th)

I was unable to use my Raspberry Pi today, so it was left idle. I am trying to find the time for it, and have plans to use the Raspberry Pi after midnight. I have plans to divide work up, so that some documents stay on the Raspberry Pi. Preparations are currently under way. My new plan from today was to install YT-DLP and see if it functions. If I recall, I got YouTube-DL to work, but it was ether too outdated to download anything, or it had missing Python support. I am really hoping it was just the outdated part, as I have known YouTube-DL to stop working for quite some time, due to development dying, and the rise of the YT-DLP fork, and I know if it was that, I could get YT-DLP to work. Still, I have no other way of downloading videos on my own devices right now, so I will try extra to get it to work, before resorting to having to borrow someone elses device.

I am still going to have to shut my Raspberry Pi down tomorrow due to expected high winds, but the hard drive backup won't be a limitation. Surprisingly, I was able to backup nearly 994 gigabytes in less than 5 hours off of a dongle. I still have to shut the Raspberry Pi down, so that I can connect it to my battery backup.

Personally, today was hard for me. I have had severe brain fog, possibly due to poor sleep for 2 nights, although there are a few other things it could have been. It severely slowed me down, and I had toi skip several things. I was able to hold off some work for tonight, and I made plans to start no new projects tomorrow, so that I can catch up and recover. This will likely open up some additional time for Raspberry Pi usage.

### [2023 July 1st](#2023-July-1st)

I briefly used my Raspberry Pi last night, but left it idle all day today. I am likely going to go to bed instead of using it, as today was hard. I found that YouTube-DL doesn't work at all, it is too outdated, and also can't compile Python, despite the Raspberry Pi having multiple versions of Python installed. Furthermore, the package for YT-DLP cannot be found.

I did not shut my Raspberry Pi down today, the weather was fine.

Personally, today was easier for me. I woke up really late, and got to hold off several projects, but still didn't feel like I got enough done. I deserved this lax day however.

I left my Raspberry Pi idle all day today yet again. I am preparing to use it as a special document handling device. I was doing really well on time today, and wasn't considering the Raspberry Pi as an option yet. My System76 Pangolin laptop came back from repairs today, so I will likely focus time on that instead of the Raspberry Pi.

I left my Raspberry Pi idle all day today yet again. I am preparing to use it as a special document handling device. I was doing really well on time today, and wasn't considering the Raspberry Pi as an option yet. My System76 Pangolin laptop came back from repairs yesterday, I didn't spend time on it yesterday, as I was fearful it would have a problem. I booted it today and left it idle, it was completely untouched digitally. I didn't have time for it today or my Raspberry Pi. The weekend should ease my workload, due to a schedule reduction, I plan to resume using the Pangolin tomorrow, and hopefully the Raspberry Pi soon. I am close to having to just shut it down. It has been running for too long.

Today, I temporarily gave my Raspberry Pis mouse and its adapter to my papa, as his work required it, and his randomly stopped working (a battery replacement didn't help, there was still no signal, and no light) a new one should be ordered soon. It was hard to get the adapter out, and I am hoping this didn't screw it up somehow.

### [2023 July 8th](#2023-July-8th)

I left my Raspberry Pi idle all day today yet again. I am preparing to use it as a special document handling device. I have mostly forgot about it for now. Today, I struggled to stay caught up, and began the process of transitioning back to the Pangolin, clearing over 300 Firefox tabs as a way of getting it ready, and getting used to the keyboard and touchpad.

Today, I got my Raspberry Pi mouse and adapter back, but did not yet plug them back in.

I left my Raspberry Pi idle all day today yet again. I am preparing to use it as a special document handling device. I have mostly forgot about it for now. Today, I used my Pangolin full time for a fifth consecutive day, and worked heavily on getting caught back up, and didn't have time for my Raspberry Pi. Using this time, I got caught back up on my Raspberry Pi blog, which was 6 days out of date.

I started a couple new projects recently, I found 2 of my old laptops, and decided that they need to stop being giant paperweights in my room, so I am going to attempt to fix and refurbish them. It will be a little experiment to see if I can repair an entire computer without help. I have a charger coming, and if anything goes wrong, there is literally nothing that can get lost other than my time. These laptops haven't been powered on in at least 3 years. I plan to give one laptop to my 2 Ukrainian friends (if I can get it working correctly) this project currently isn't using any of my time, as I don't have a way of powering on the laptops without the charger, so I have to wait.

Prerequisites for getting back onto my Raspberry Pi:

- [ ] Plug the mouse adapter back in
- [ ] Find time (at least 30 minutes)
- [ ] Find a purpose

I plan to give one laptop to my 2 Ukrainian friends (if I can get it working correctly) this project currently isn't using very much of my time, as I don't have a way of powering on the laptops without the charger, so I have to wait. The charger is expected to arrive on 2023 July 21st, so I have to wait. No progress was made on this task today.

Prerequisites for getting back onto my Raspberry Pi:

- [ ] Plug the mouse adapter back in
- [ ] Find time (at least 30 minutes)
- [ ] Find a purpose
- [ ] Find motivation

I am additionally working on formatting a hard drive, so that I can put it into a computer for use in data backups. I am still having difficulty getting it to read. I am now considering plugging it into the Raspberry Pi to see if it recognizes it, as both of my laptops can run it, but can't read from it or access it. I am planning on beginning to make use of my Raspberry Pis 4 USB ports as well, with plans to put a USB hub in to reduce port usage by 1 to 2. For my reference: [2023 June 27th](#2023-June-27th)

### [2023 July 19th](#2023-July-19th)

My Raspberry Pi was left shut down today. I am preparing to use it as a special document handling device. I used my Pangolin full time for a eleventh consecutive day today, but I am working on staying caught up. I shut my Raspberry Pi down this morning due to excessive uptime. I used the `shutdown` command in the terminal, as I didn't have my mouse handy. The shutdown prompt through the terminal was cool, it waits exactly 1 minute, then it goes to a black screen with the command line equivalent of the Windows 9x "It is now safe to turn off your computer" text.

I started a couple new projects recently, I found 2 of my old laptops, and decided that they need to stop being giant paperweights in my room, so I am going to attempt to fix and refurbish them. It will be a little experiment to see if I can repair an entire computer without help.

My Raspberry Pi was left shut down today. I am preparing to use it as a special document handling device. I used my Pangolin full time for a twelfth consecutive day today, but I am working on staying caught up. I am giving the Raspberry Pi 2-3 days before I turn it back on as a cooldown period to make up for the excessive uptime. I won't turn it back on until I am ready to do the special document handling device idea.

I won't turn it back on until I am ready to do the special document handling device idea.

I had a very hard night last night, and a difficult morning. This is the 3rd night in a row where I severely underslept. This morning was agony for me, lasting several hours, until I eventually recovered around 11:40 am. This set me back a few hours, so I will have less time to do other things today, including the Raspberry Pi.

Yesterday, I had an extremely good trip out of the house, and realized I need to do this much more often. Due to recent issues with my sleep, and other issues, I have decided that I will be leaving the city for a few days, starting 2023 July 23rd. My Raspberry Pi usage will be impossible from this distance, and all new projects will be held off. An end date has not yet been defined, although it should end for sure by 2023 July 29th.

I got better sleep last night, and feel like I am starting to go back to normal (to the mental state of about 5 weeks ago) I started my 2023 July vacation a couple days ago, and won't be back until 2023 July 27th, so the Raspberry Pi will not be usable in this time.

So the application guide is pretty much useless. I feel this would be better for their usage case, so I am abandoning at least 6 pages of the manual, unless I end up finding installing S mode to be too difficult and going back on the plans, but unfortunately, this doesn't seem likely. Luckily, there are still at least 4 useful pages of the manual.

I used my Pangolin full time for a seventeenth consecutive day today, but I am working on staying caught up. I won't turn it back on until I am ready to do the special document handling device idea.

I spent a lot of time on various projects today. I am not sure whether I will use my Raspberry Pi today, it seems unlikely.

I have a project regarding 2 old laptops, which I will donate one if I can repair it and get it functional. The project is still on pause.

Prerequisites for getting back onto my Raspberry Pi:

- [ ] Plug the mouse adapter back in
- [ ] Find time (at least 30 minutes)
- [ ] Find a purpose
- [ ] Find motivation

I am additionally working on formatting a hard drive, so that I can put it into a computer for use in data backups. I am still having difficulty getting it to read. I am now considering plugging it into the Raspberry Pi to see if it recognizes it, as both of my laptops can run it, but can't read from it or access it. I am planning on beginning to make use of my Raspberry Pis 4 USB ports as well, with plans to put a USB hub in to reduce port usage by 1 to 2. For my reference: [2023 June 27th](#2023-June-27th)

My Raspberry Pi was left shut down today. I am preparing to use it as a special document handling device. I used my Pangolin full time for a seventeenth consecutive day today, but I am working on staying caught up. I won't turn it back on until I am ready to do the special document handling device idea.

I got back into a couple of games last night, after a hiatus of nearly 2 years. Things are starting to change again in my schedule. Due to another system crash today, and the possible relation of audio conversion to the crash, I have decided that from now on, audio conversion will be done solely on the Raspberry Pi, even if it is just 1 file of less than 0.5 second duration. Because of this, I am planning to boot my Raspberry Pi back up tomorrow. I am looking into an experiment regarding external devices and how the Raspberry Pi recognizes/interacts with them. I plan to test this by plugging my first external hard drive into the RPi, as it has the lowest data risk out of my hard drives, since everything has been transitioned to newer drives. If successful, this 1 terabyte drive may become a primary Raspberry Pi component.

I have a project regarding 2 old laptops, which I will donate one if I can repair it and get it functional. The project is still on pause.

My Raspberry Pi remained idle again today for a 3rd day. I am preparing to use it as a special document handling device. I won't start using it until I am ready. I failed to update my Raspberry Pi blog for a third consecutive day as well.

Due to another system crash on 2023, August 2nd, and the possible relation of audio conversion to the crash, I have decided that from now on, audio conversion will be done solely on the Raspberry Pi, even if it is just 1 file of less than 0.5 second duration.

I have a project regarding 2 old laptops, which I will donate one if I can repair it and get it functional. The project resumed today, but hit a major roadblock: I am told there is a different laptop that can be given to them that would fit them better, one that has even less usage, and fully functional components. Additionally, I found a lot on this laptop that I am thinking about, such as virtual machines and 32-bit Windows games. The laptop booted successfully today, I forgot how slow Windows is. The laptop isn't solid state, and only has 4 gigabytes of RAM, but I don't think this justifies a 5 minute boot time (3.5 minutes from power button to desktop, another 1.5 minutes for it to load all of the icons on the taskbar (less than 35))

My Raspberry Pi remained idle again today for a 5th day. I am preparing to use it as a special document handling device. I won't start using it until I am ready. I kept my Raspberry Pi blog up to date today, but had a difficult time with my schedule. There is almost zero chance I will use my Raspberry Pi tonight. I spent a lot of time working with spreadsheets today, and I am now curious as to how well a Raspberry Pi 4 can handle spreadsheets via LibreOffice Calc? It is something I will eventually find out.

My Raspberry Pi remained idle again today for a 6th day. I am preparing to use it as a special document handling device. I won't start using it until I am ready. I kept my Raspberry Pi blog up to date today, but still didn't do the best schedule wise. I am going to try and go to bed earlier tonight, so I won't use my Raspberry Pi again. I am preparing the next batch of files to transfer. I am also considering permanently disabling the Wi-Fi connection on my Raspberry Pi for security reasons (on the current configuration only) the only issue with this is having to reconfigure the clock every time I boot.

My Raspberry Pi remained idle again today for an 8th consecutive day. I am preparing to use it as a special document handling device. I won't start using it until I am ready. I got my Raspberry Pi blog back up to date again tonight. I am going to try and go to bed earlier tonight, so I won't use my Raspberry Pi again. I am preparing the next batch of files to transfer. I have made the decision to permanently disable the Internet when I get back onto this configuration, and will continue to do so until I can find a way to get system updates (likely through another SD card) due to issues with the clock, I now plan a task for each time I boot the Raspberry Pi, that I call boot-time_clock-setting. It may be tedious to remember, and I may forget, so I might just have a simple shell script launch the clock upon each boot. The reason the clock is a problem, is because turning the Wi-Fi off prevents the computer from accessing Internet time, which will make it more and more off, each time you reboot. I still need time-based instructions for certain tasks, so this workaround is still necessary.

My Raspberry Pi remained idle again today for a 15th consecutive day. I am preparing to use it as a special document handling device. I won't start using it until I am ready. I did not update my Raspberry Pi blog today. The Internet is being disabled on my current Raspberry Pi configuration, see the [2023 August 10th entry](#2023-August-10th) for more information.

I had interest in using the Raspberry Pi today (2023, Tuesday, August 15th) but not enough to cross a threshold of interest. I am again struggling with time, although I had a lot more of it today. I am considering using it tonight, but this isn't a guarantee. My interest is mostly rooted around nostalgia, which is a very strong force that can get me to do a lot of things.

Due to another system crash on 2023, August 2nd, and the possible relation of audio conversion to the crash, I have decided that from now on, audio conversion will be done solely on the Raspberry Pi, even if it is just 1 file of less than 0.5 second duration. For more information, see the [2023 August 8th entry](#2023-August-8th)

I have a project regarding 2 old laptops, which I will donate one if I can repair it and get it functional. The project paused again on 2023, August 6th. See [2023 August 5th](#2023-August-5th) for information about the situation.

Prerequisites for getting back onto my Raspberry Pi:

- [ ] Plug the mouse adapter back in
- [ ] Find time (at least 30 minutes)
- [ ] Find a purpose
- [ ] Find motivation

### [2023 August 19th](#2023-August-19th)

My Raspberry Pi remained idle again today for a 17th consecutive day. I am preparing to use it as a special document handling device. I won't start using it until I am ready. I kept my Raspberry Pi blog back up to date today. I was really tempted to use it yesterday, but I just didn't have the time. The Internet is being disabled on my current Raspberry Pi configuration, see the [2023 August 10th entry](#2023-August-10th) for more information.

Old, but needs revisit

- [x] 4K display: make it so I don't have to wear glasses AND strain my eyes to see what I am doing (I am really glad it is not an 8K or higher device because of this reason) In a nutshell: fix the display resolution (I have 2 1080p displays, so this wasn't an issue. I was using another device originally to test it. It will need to be looked at in the future though.)

Other things to do:

- [ ] Make a text corpus with as many languages as possible, with English labels, and test which ones are compatible with Raspberry Pi OS, and which ones aren't.

> Confirmed to work: Latin/English, Japanese, Chinese, Punjabi

> Confirmed to not work: Korean

- [ ] Test: what GitHub is like on the Raspberry Pi, and if I need to keep my sessions separate from each other [device independant]

> Progress: I can't even log in, as the current version of Chromium that comes with the Raspberry Pi isn't supported. When I figure out how to install another browser, I will try again.

## [Known issues with external hardware](#Known-issues-with-external-hardware)

These are the known issues I haven't gotten to talking about until now. They are dependant on the external hardware I am using, and not the Raspberry Pi itself.

- [x] The Mouse freezes with every minute of inactivity, you have to click anywhere to wake it up (Don't know how to fix this)

- [x] The screen has low color quality

- [ ] No other known issues with my hardware

## [Daily status](#Daily-status)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</u></b></p></summary>

I haven't gotten to use my Pi4 for a while. My current goal is to get the TV to stay on long enough first (and not have it shut down/go into sleep mode after every 15 minutes) it is hindering me from starting usage. - 2022 January 10th

I forgot to mention my Raspberry Pi game night on 2022 Saturday, January 8th. It was really fun, and I stayed up way too late (past 4 am) I didn't use my own Pi, but I plan to next time for the games.

I still haven't gotten to use my Pi recently. I am still bummed out about the sleep mode problem, and the fact that my Pi had to have a hard reset to resume usage. I was given a Ubuntu SD card, based on the experience of the other Raspberry Pi user in the house, it didn't go well, here is what happened:

* User2 used a 32 gigabyte SanDisk SD card with Ubuntu 21.04

* The installation went fine, but the moment he tried to use a file manager (I assume: GNOME Files/Nautilus) the system froze up completely (both keyboard and mouse unresponsive, frames per second: 0) and had to be hard reset

* It hasn't been attempted since. I have been given a fresh SD card to experiment with it on my own.

</details>

I fixed the sleep mode issue today on the TV without installing the evil operating system in full, now I just have to do it on each operating system setup.

Today, I tried to work on getting Ubuntu to set up, but failed. I didn't really use the Pi much today. Other than this, I learnt how to take out SD cards and put them into the Pi on my own, without much difficulty. - 2022 Thursday, January 13th

## [Major plans]#Major-plans)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</u></b></p></summary>

I have decided to make the Raspberry Pi my primary desktop computer class B. I just realized the full potential of having a Raspberry Pi, and it helps mitigate the device failures I have been having.

One major advantage is that I can store the entire operating system on an external medium, something I have never been able to do before, and have always wanted to do. This includes all program data, all system files, all user files, all configuration files, and the rest. I was never able to do this with my normal Windows or Ubuntu installations.

</details>

### [Other plans](#Other-plans)

#### [SD Card clone, Ruby, Scarlet Oven](#SD-Card-clone--Ruby--Scarlet-Oven)

I hope to eventually do an SD card clone of my Raspberry Pi. Once I do this, I am considering installing Ruby, and eventually getting Scarlet Oven to run on it. In the meantime, I hope to eventually get to adding audio metadata.

#### [Reduce or keep monitor count of 2](#Reduce-or-keep-monitor-count-of-2)

I am considering building a desktop computer separate from the Raspberry Pi, and I am deciding whether the Raspberry Pi needs 2 monitors or not. The decision started on 2022, Thursday, September 29th <!-- But it was not logged until 2022, Friday, September 30th !-->

**Oppose:** The monitor for this new computer will be a touchscreen monitor. There likely won't be space for 3 monitors in this one area.

**Keep:** Certain tasks are good with 2 screenshots

~~**Compromise:** Switch between the 2 monitors on the Raspberry Pi and the new computer~~

#### [Take the case off](#Take-the-case-off)

The case is nice and decorative, but it makes it hard to take an SD card out, or put one in. As long as there is a fan attached, it should work fine without a case.

#### [Better document my Raspberry Pi setup](#Better-document-my-Raspberry-Pi-setup)

**Raspberry Pi tour**

I plan to get videos and pictures, both on Ubuntu, and the Raspberry Pi itself of my digital Raspberry Pi setup, along with the hardware setup as well. I just need to tidy it up first.

#### [Increase Scratch usage](#Increase-Scratch-usage)

I want to start using Scratch again for certain projects. I also want to see if I can get Scratch 3 to run on the Raspberry Pi.

## [Abandoned notes](#Abandoned-notes)

Weekly Raspberry Pi day to be Wednesday or Thursday

I have ruled out the idea of a `Raspberry Pi laptop` as the performance wouldn't be good enough, and the hardware just isn't possible.

I have also grown more interest in a `developer chip` an SD card running Linux that can natively run as many programming languages as possible (this is a challenge, I can't even get Ubuntu to load on the Pi yet, but I eventually want to get a system that can run any programming language, even those that are a bit obscure, like Go! or Svelte (and other not as common languages))

Still no hyperlink for spill protection tubes (still can't remember the name)

LXDE is very ugly, but extremely inefficient | image overload didn't overload

Intend to update Raspberry Pi blog banner picture eventually

Power outage at some point earlier this week

## [Uptime](#Uptime)

### [Uptime History](#Uptime-History)

#### [Uptime Streak 1](#Uptime-Streak-1)

The Raspberry Pi was previously running continuously since 2022 Tuesday April 19th at 8:12 pm. On 2022, June 2nd, due to 2 power flickers, and the fact that I haven't actually used the Raspberry Pi in at least 2 weeks, I decided to shut down, thus ending the streak. It was a little bit depressing, but I will get back to it again eventually.

#### [Uptime Records](#Uptime-Records)

**Uptime record:** 42.89 days (6 weeks, 0 days)

**Current uptime:** 0.00 days (0 weeks, 0 days) (as of 2022, August 23rd)

***

## [Planned upgrades](#Planned-upgrades)

### [Dual-boot I](#Dual-boot-I)

I have 2 bootable SD cards that my Raspberry Pi operates, one of them for productivity and general use, and one for gaming. It has been an inconvenience to take the SD card out and put another one in. It is already hard enough just to get the 1 SD card to boot every time. I feel a dual boot modification would be a good idea.

#### [Blueprints](#Blueprints)

There will be a secondary SD card slot added to the Raspberry Pi. Upon booting the device, there will be a prompt to ask which system (SD card + system) to boot from. There might be some difficult software modifications needed to bring up a GRUB dualboot screen, possibly a 3rd storage device that isn't an SD card.

I am still unsure how I will get this to work. I am currently unsure if it is possible.

### [Planned drives](#Planned-drives)

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b><u>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</u></b></p></summary>

These are my planned external drives for my Raspberry Pi setup. It's going to be a Swap-a-thon!

- [x] I have a default test drive (capacity: 128 gigabytes | type: SD card (durable) )
- [x] I have a RetroPie drive (capacity: 128 gigabytes | type: SD card (durable) )
- [ ] I plan to have a development drive, a device with tons of development tools installed for as many programming languages as possible. It will likely run Ubuntu due to Ubuntus great support for software libraries and packages.
- [ ] I plan to have a drive for SNU development, so I can resume development on the site with better potential.
- [ ] I plan to have a family photo drive, for family photos
- [ ] I plan to have an entertainment class W drive for specific leisure content.
- [ ] I plan to have a normal drive for normal system development and everyday tasks.
- [ ] I plan to have a music drive for my music collection.
- [ ] I plan to have a book drive for my digital books, and my WikiPDF collection
- [ ] I plan to have a Reddit drive for my Reddit saves.
- [ ] I plan to have a website collection drive for my useful website rips
- [ ] I plan to have a second gaming drive that is separate from the RetroPie
- [ ] I plan to have a virtual machine drive for virtual machine usage (first: test to see the performance of VirtualBox/Another VM Hypervisor in a dummy drive)
- [ ] No other planned drives at the moment

</details>

### [Cost](#Cost)

I can easily have a 4 terabyte external hard drive as the system drive. There currently is no known laptop equivalent for this. A 4 terabyte hard drive is super cheap, I could buy 12 terabytes worth of storage for what the 1 terabyte solid state drive in my current laptop costs.

## [Scratch development](#Scratch-development)

<!-- I plan to get back into Scratch development and usage for graphic design, archival, testing, sampling, and reference. !--->

I have developed some Scratch projects on the Pi, including:

- [x] The first 6 versions of the Scratch Edition of the StealthGeo font [View them here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/StealthGeo_Font/tree/StealthGeo-main/Prototype/Scratch/2/)

I have noted that big projects, or possibly projects created with a different version of Scratch, are not compatible with the Electron version of Scratch that is pre-installed in the Raspberry Pi operating system.
