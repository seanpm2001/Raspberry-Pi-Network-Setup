# Raspberry-Pi-Network-Setup
My personal and professional Raspberry Pi setups.

***

## About

See above. This is my core Raspberry Pi repository. Originally, it was only used for setup scripts, but now a daily Raspberry Pi blog is in use [here](/Learn-Pi/New-Pi/) it has since become one of the core focuses of this project.

***

## Wiki

[Click/tap here to view this projects Wiki](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Raspberry-Pi-Network-Setup/wiki)

If the project has been forked, the Wiki was likely removed. Luckily, I include an embedded version. You can view it [here](/External/ProjectWiki/).

***

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

***

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
