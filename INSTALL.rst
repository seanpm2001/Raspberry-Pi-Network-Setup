Installing seanpm2001/Raspberry-Pi-Network-Setup
----

This Raspberry Pi network setup project currently doesn't require installation, it is just a collection of images and data. It is part of the Seanpm2001 Life Archive project, and for proper "installation" the repository should be placed under `/SeansLifeArchive/<yourInstalledVersion>//Extras/<name_of_project>/`

If you want to load the first project language file, you will need to have anPython IDE/Interpreter and a package of any version of the Python programming prior to version 3.5.

If you want to view the image files, the majority of files are in PNG format. Make sure your computer can handle images of 1920x200000/2560x1440/2560x1080/1920x1080 resolution well, and that your computer can handle JPG files.

Some image files are in other formats, such as SVG, and JPG. You will need support for viewing these files to view these files.

Some included files are in Markdown format (*.md) for best viewing, you should use a markdown viewer/markdown editor.

Some included files are in PDF format. They should be opened with a document viewer capable of handling PDF documents.
