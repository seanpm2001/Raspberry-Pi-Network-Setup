# About: 
# I chose Ruby as the fourth project language file for this project (seanpm2001/Raspberry-Pi-Network-Setup) as for software diversity reasons, I can't write everything purely in Python. I don't have very many Ruby projects at the moment, and I feel like it would be good to write some Raspberry Pi programs in Ruby (such as Scarlet Oven) Rubys are typically red, and the Ruby logo will likely always be red, so it can partially support the color theme for the projects as well.
