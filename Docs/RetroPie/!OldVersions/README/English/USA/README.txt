### 6th generation

#### Raspberry Pi 4

It is currently impossible to emulate a 6th generation (or later) video game console on the Raspberry Pi 4. This doesn't have as much to do with CPU as it does GPU.

### 7th generation

#### Raspberry Pi 4

It is currently impossible to emulate a 6th generation (or later) video game console on the Raspberry Pi 4.

### 8th generation

#### Raspberry Pi 4

It is currently impossible to emulate a 6th generation (or later) video game console on the Raspberry Pi 4.

### 9th generation

#### Raspberry Pi 4

It is currently impossible to emulate a 6th generation (or later) video game console on the Raspberry Pi 4.
