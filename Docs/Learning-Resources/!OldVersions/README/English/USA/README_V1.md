> > `SD wear is probably a greatly exaggerated issue in this kind of use. People have no problem writing gigabytes of data to a card weekly for years on end in a camera, for example. The question also hints that data is sent to a network service, which means there may be no need for volatile storage other than RAM and the whole card could spend its normal life read-only. Keeping a backup and replacing the card with a fresh one every n years is also cheap.` â€“ [XTL](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/users/1139/xtl/) 2012, August 15th at 8:00 am
