### Ubuntu on Raspberry Pi goals

- [ ] Install the system successfully and keep the system installed for 7 days

- [ ] Delete Google Chrome and Google Chromium

- [ ] Make a lite setup for journaling and important tasks

#### Install tests

I have been experimenting with Ubuntu on Raspberry Pi. It hasn't been successful so far.

**Trial 1** `(2 tests)`

**Version:** `Ubuntu 21.04 (64 bit)`

**Attempts:** `5+ (on 2 different Raspberry PIs, on 2 different 32 gigabyte SanDIsk SD cards`

**Result:** `Complete system lockup, cannot get past desktop`

T1T1: Successfully installed, reached the desktop, immediate crash upon opening Nautilus, soft lock

T1T2: Restarted 4 times | first restart: stuck on desktop, screen 2 miscolored | second restart: stuck on installation screen, with no install window | third restart: got stuck on a screen with 3 out of 4 orange dots, with random Us and unknown characters on the screen | fourth restart: made it to desktop, with icons, skipped installation, system softlocked for a fourth time

Notes: The time is set to October for some reason, and the clock doesn't move, so I know it isn't just the keyboard and mouse being unresponsive.

T1T1 = Trial 1 Test 1 | T1T2 = Trial 1 Test 2

I am going to try a different version of Ubuntu next. I hope I can get Ubuntu to work, due to its app support, recognized API and interface, and stability, as my current laptop is badly failing, and I may need to use the Raspberry Pi as a backup until I can repair the keyboard for a second time.
